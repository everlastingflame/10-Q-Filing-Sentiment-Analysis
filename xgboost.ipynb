In order to better understand such changes, readers of this MD&A should also read:\\u2022The discussion of the critical and significant accounting policies used by the Company in preparing its consolidated financial statements. The most current discussion of our critical accounting policies appears in Item 7, Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2022 Form 10-K, and the most current discussion of our significant accounting policies appears in Note 2- Significant Accounting Polices in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2022 Form 10-K;\\u2022The Company\\u2019s fiscal 2022 audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2022 Form 10-K; and\\u2022Item\\u00a07, Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2022 Form 10-K.In addition to historical information, this MD&A and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements that do not directly relate to any historical or current fact. When used herein, words such as \\u201cexpects,\\u201d \\u201canticipates,\\u201d \\u201cbelieves,\\u201d \\u201cseeks,\\u201d \\u201cestimates,\\u201d \\u201cplans,\\u201d \\u201cintends,\\u201d \\u201cfuture,\\u201d \\u201cwill,\\u201d \\u201cwould,\\u201d \\u201ccould,\\u201d \\u201ccan,\\u201d \\u201cmay,\\u201d and similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make concerning our business, financial condition and results of operations and our expectations as to our future growth, prospects, financial outlook and business strategy for fiscal year 2023 or future fiscal years, our expectations for the percentage of backlog we will realize as revenue in fiscal year 2023, and the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or the strategic investment in PA Consulting. Although such statements are based on management\\u2019s current estimates and expectations, and/or currently available competitive, financial, and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. We caution the reader that there are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. Such factors include our ability to execute on our three-year corporate strategy, including our ability to invest in the tools needed to fully implement our strategy, competition from existing and future competitors in our target markets, our ability to achieve the cost-savings and synergies contemplated by our recent acquisitions within the expected time frames or to achieve them fully and to successfully integrate acquired businesses while retaining key personnel, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic, and any resulting economic downturn on our results, prospects and opportunities, measures or restrictions imposed by governments and health officials in response to such pandemic, the timing of the award of projects and funding and potential changes to the amounts provided for, under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, financial market risks that may affect the Company, including by affecting the Company's access to capital, the cost of such capital and/or the Company's funding obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, as well as general economic conditions, including inflation and the actions taken by monetary authorities in response to inflation, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in capital markets, the impact of a possible recession or economic downturn on our results, prospects and opportunities, and geopolitical events and conflicts, among others. The impact of such matters includes, but is not limited to, the possible reduction in demand for certain of our product solutions and services and the delay or abandonment of ongoing or anticipated projects due to the financial condition of our clients and suppliers or to governmental budget constraints or changes to governmental budgetary priorities; the inability of our clients to meet their payment obligations in a timely manner or at all; potential issues and risks related to a significant portion of our employees working remotely; illness, travel restrictions and other workforce disruptions that have and could continue to negatively affect our supply chain and our ability to timely and satisfactorily complete our clients\\u2019 projects; difficulties associated with retaining and hiring additional employees; and the inability of governments in certain of the countries in which we operate to effectively mitigate the financial or other impacts of pandemics on their economies and workforces and our operations therein. The foregoing factors and potential future developments are inherently uncertain, unpredictable and, in many cases, beyond our control. For a description of these and additional factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see those listed and discussed in Item\\u00a01A, Risk Factors included in our 2022 Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements. We encourage you to read carefully the risk factors, as well as the financial and business disclosures contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other documents we file from time to time with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \\\"SEC\\\").Page 33Business OverviewAt Jacobs, we\\u2019re challenging today to reinvent tomorrow by solving the world\\u2019s most critical problems for thriving cities, resilient environments, mission-critical outcomes, operational advancement, scientific discovery and cutting-edge manufacturing, turning abstract ideas into realities that transform the world for good. Leveraging a talent force of more than 60,000, Jacobs provides a full spectrum of professional services including consulting, technical, engineering, scientific and project delivery for the government and private sectors.Our previous three-year corporate strategy launched at our Investor Day in February 2019 focused on innovation and continued transformation to build upon our position as the leading solutions provider for our clients. Setting the wheels in motion for our current path, this transformation included acquiring a 65% stake in PA Consulting Group Limited (\\\"PA Consulting\\\") in fiscal year 2021. Acquisitions of John Wood Group\\u2019s nuclear business, The Buffalo Group and most recently BlackLynx and StreetLight further position us as a leader in high-value government services and technology-enabled solutions.We are now focused on broadening our leadership in sustainable, high growth sectors. As part of our strategy, our brand promise: \\\"Challenging today. Reinventing tomorrow.\\\" signals our transition to a global technology-forward solutions company. We began trading as \\u201cJ\\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2019, and in March 2021 our Global Industry Classifications Standard code changed to Research & Consulting Services. Our Focus 2023 Transformation Office is charged with driving further innovation, delivering value-creating solutions for our clients and leveraging an integrated digital and technology strategy to improve our efficiency and effectiveness, ultimately freeing up valuable time and resources for reinvestment in our people.In the fourth quarter fiscal 2022, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (the predecessor parent company) created a new holding company, Jacobs Solutions Inc., which, through a reverse triangular merger, became the new parent company of Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. As a result of the transaction, the predecessor parent company's then-current stockholders automatically became stockholders of Jacobs Solutions Inc., on a one-for-one basis, with the same number of shares and same ownership percentage of the predecessor parent company\\u2019s common stock that they held immediately prior to the transaction.

While operating profit levels were up for the respective three-month periods of fiscal 2023 due primarily to our P&PS business, the first fiscal quarter of 2023 was impacted by $39.7 million in pre-tax Restructuring and other charges and transaction costs compared to fiscal 2022 amounts of $75.0\\u00a0million, for both periods associated mainly with the Company's transformation initiatives relating to real estate which is discussed in Note 16- Restructuring and Other Charges. Additionally, the 2023 first fiscal quarter was impacted by approximately $15.0 million in net favorable impacts from overhead cost reductions associated mainly with one-time benefit program changes, while partly offset by higher incentive and other compensation charges and higher investments in company technology platforms. Also, first quarter fiscal 2023 other expense, net, of $40.3 million was higher by $32.1\\u00a0million versus first quarter fiscal 2022 amounts of $8.2 million, with the current period primarily impacted by unfavorable higher net interest expense compared to the prior year quarter as discussed further below. Our reported net earnings for the current year quarter were unfavorably impacted by higher income taxes of $34.2 million compared to the fiscal 2022 period, attributable to higher effective tax rates in the current quarter due mainly to the absence of prior year tax benefits including $15.7\\u00a0million related to the release of previously valued foreign tax credits and other prior year favorable tax items combined with current quarter income tax expense items further discussed in Note 9- Income Taxes. Additionally, redeemable noncontrolling interests was $5.7\\u00a0million lower in the current quarter due to unfavorable net earnings results in our PA Consulting investment compared to the prior year quarter. On February 4, 2022, the Company acquired StreetLight Data, Inc., (\\\"StreetLight\\\"). For further discussion, see Note 15- Other Business Combinations.Consolidated Results of OperationsRevenues for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 were $3.80 billion, an increase of $418.0 million, or 12.4%, from $3.38 billion for the corresponding period last year. Revenue increases for the year over year period were due mainly to the Company's P&PS and CMS legacy businesses and in addition, to a smaller degree, fiscal 2023 incremental revenues benefited from the StreetLight acquisition (owned for the full period in fiscal 2023) and other increases in our DVS business. The P&PS business benefited primarily from stronger performance in its Advanced Facilities and U.S. business operations. Our CMS business benefited from increased spending in our U.S. government business sector, which was primarily attributable to fiscal 2022 contract awards for the U.S. Department of Energy. Due to foreign currency translation impacts, revenues in our PA Consulting investment decreased (excluding translation impacts, PA Consulting experienced year over year growth). Also, revenue was unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation of $158.5 million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 in our international businesses, with no significant impact in the prior year period. Pass-through costs included in revenues for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 amounted to $673.7 million, an increase of $195.6 million, or 40.9%, from $478.1 million from the corresponding period last year.Gross profit for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 was $814.7 million, an increase of $18.2 million, or 2.3%, from $796.5 million from the corresponding period last year. Our gross profit margins were 21.4% and 23.6% for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 and December\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, with these margin differences being mainly attributable to lower utilization trends primarily in the PA Consulting business, project mix impacts in our legacy CMS portfolio and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts, partly offset by new program startups won in fiscal 2022 and favorable performance in our P&PS advanced facilities and U.S. businesses. Additionally, gross profit benefited from favorable impacts from overhead cost reductions associated mainly with one-time benefit program changes, while partly offset by higher incentive and other compensation charges and higher investments in company technology platforms in the current year, as mentioned above.See Segment Financial Information discussion for further information on the Company\\u2019s results of operations at the operating segment.SG&A expenses for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 were $576.9 million, a decrease of $42.2 million or (6.8)% from $619.1 million for the corresponding period last year. The current year's three months ended results were impacted by decreases in real estate related costs, as well as other department spend decreases due in part to the Company's transformation initiatives. Also, Restructuring and other charges for fiscal 2023 and 2022 included $27.1 million and $73.2\\u00a0million, respectively, in costs associated with the Company's transformation initiatives relating to real Page 37estate. Lastly, SG&A expenses benefited from favorable foreign exchange impacts of $27.5 million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022, with no significant impact in the corresponding prior year period. Net interest expense for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was $37.1 million, an increase of $19.1 million from $17.9 million for the corresponding period last year. The increase in net interest expense for the three month period was due to higher levels of debt outstanding due to the funding of the StreetLight and BlackLynx acquisitions and increased borrowings associated with the payment of the settlement of a legacy litigation matter involving a subsidiary of CH2M (the \\\"Legacy CH2M Matter\\\") in fiscal 2022, in addition to higher interest rates. Miscellaneous (expense) income, net for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was $(3.3) million in comparison to $9.7 million for the corresponding period last year. The $12.9 million decrease from the prior three-month comparable period was due primarily to an increase in pension costs due to higher interest rate impacts in the current year along with the prior year $6.9 million gain related to a lease termination.The Company\\u2019s effective tax rates from continuing operations for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 and December\\u00a031, 2021 were 25.4% and 9.4%, respectively. The most significant items contributing to the difference between the statutory U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21.0% and the Company\\u2019s effective tax rate for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 were U.S. state income tax expense of $4.6\\u00a0million and U.S. tax on foreign earnings of $3.6\\u00a0million. Both items are expected to have a continuing impact on the Company's effective tax rate for the remainder of the fiscal year. The most significant items contributing to the difference between the statutory U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21.0% and the Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended December\\u00a031, 2021 were a tax benefit of $15.7\\u00a0million related to the release of previously reserved foreign tax credit assets, $4.2\\u00a0million excess tax benefit attributable to stock compensation, and $4.0\\u00a0million benefit from filing amended state returns.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by tax jurisdictions around the world. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, India, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to our assessment of the relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at the time. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may impact our effective tax rate.Page 38Segment Financial InformationThe following table provides selected financial information for our operating segments and includes a reconciliation of segment operating profit to total U.S. GAAP operating profit from continuing operations by including certain corporate-level expenses, Restructuring and other charges and transaction and integration costs (in thousands).Three Months EndedDecember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Revenues from External Customers:Critical Mission Solutions$1,075,175\\u00a0$976,777\\u00a0People & Places Solutions2,226,985\\u00a01,920,997\\u00a0Divergent Solutions214,465\\u00a0192,877\\u00a0PA Consulting282,043\\u00a0289,974\\u00a0Total$3,798,668\\u00a0$3,380,625\\u00a0Three Months EndedDecember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Segment Operating Profit:Critical Mission Solutions$82,220\\u00a0$91,239\\u00a0People & Places Solutions226,619\\u00a0188,841\\u00a0Divergent Solutions11,967\\u00a023,108\\u00a0PA Consulting51,027\\u00a063,071\\u00a0Total Segment Operating Profit371,833\\u00a0366,259\\u00a0Other Corporate Expenses (1)(93,686)(105,360)Restructuring, Transaction and Other Charges (2)(40,342)(83,566)Total U.S. GAAP Operating Profit 237,805\\u00a0177,333\\u00a0Total Other Income (Expense), net (3)(40,324)(8,243)Earnings Before Taxes from Continuing Operations$197,481\\u00a0$169,090\\u00a0(1)Other corporate expenses included intangibles amortization of $49.8 million and $46.9 million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 and December\\u00a031, 2021, respectively. Additionally, the three month period of fiscal 2023 included approximately $15.0 million in net favorable impacts from cost reductions compared to the prior year period, which was associated mainly with net favorable impacts during the current quarter from changes in employee benefit programs of $41 million offset by approximately $26 million in higher quarter over quarter spend in company technology platforms and other personnel and corporate cost increases.(2)Included in the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 and December\\u00a031, 2021 are $27.1 million and $72.3 million, respectively, in real estate impairment charges related to the Company's transformation initiatives.(3)The three months ended December\\u00a031, 2021 included a gain of $6.9 million related to a lease termination. Additionally, the increase in net interest expense year over year is primarily due to the higher levels of debt outstanding due to the funding of the StreetLight and BlackLynx acquisitions in fiscal 2022 and increased borrowings associated with the payment of the Legacy CH2M Matter settlement also in the prior year, in addition to higher interest rates.Page 39Critical Mission SolutionsThree Months EndedDecember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Revenue$1,075,175\\u00a0$976,777\\u00a0Operating Profit$82,220\\u00a0$91,239\\u00a0Critical Mission Solutions (CMS) segment revenues for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 were $1.08 billion, an increase of $98.4 million, or 10.1%, from $976.8 million for the corresponding period last year. During the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022, revenue benefited from contracts awarded in late fiscal 2022, including the Department of Energy Nuclear remediation program. Also, impacts on revenues from unfavorable foreign currency translation were approximately $33.1\\u00a0million for the three month period ended December\\u00a030, 2022, compared to $2.2\\u00a0million in favorable impacts in the corresponding prior year period.Operating profit for the segment was $82.2 million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022, representing a decrease of $9.0 million, or (9.9)%, from $91.2 million for the corresponding period last year. Operating profit levels were down from the prior year, with impacts from large contract wind downs in early fiscal 2022, which carried higher profit margins, offset in part by growth in nuclear remediation work for the U.S. Department of Energy noted above. Impacts on operating profit from unfavorable foreign currency translation were approximately $3.9\\u00a0million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022, as compared to insignificant impacts in the corresponding prior year period.People & Places SolutionsThree Months EndedDecember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Revenue$2,226,985\\u00a0$1,920,997\\u00a0Operating Profit$226,619\\u00a0$188,841\\u00a0Revenues for the People & Places Solutions (P&PS) segment for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was $2.23 billion, an increase of $306.0\\u00a0million, or 15.9%, from $1.92 billion for the corresponding period last year. The increase in revenue for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was primarily driven by growth in both our advanced facilities and U.S. businesses as compared to the prior year corresponding period. Foreign currency translation had a $83.2\\u00a0million unfavorable impact on revenues in our international businesses for the three period ended December\\u00a030, 2022, respectively, as compared to unfavorable impacts of $2.6\\u00a0million in the corresponding prior year period.Operating profit for the segment for the three month period ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was $226.6 million, an increase of $37.8 million, or 20.0%, from $188.8 million for the corresponding period last year. The year-over-year increase in operating profit for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was driven primarily by the revenue growth mentioned above while holding selling, general and administrative expenses relatively flat. Foreign currency translation had a $15.9\\u00a0million unfavorable impact on operating profit in our international businesses for the three month periods ended December\\u00a030, 2022, respectively as compared to insignificant impacts in the corresponding prior year period.Page 40Divergent SolutionsThree Months EndedDecember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Revenue$214,465\\u00a0$192,877\\u00a0Operating Profit$11,967\\u00a0$23,108\\u00a0Revenues for the Divergent Solutions segment for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 were $214.5\\u00a0million, an increase of $21.6 million, or 11.2%, from $192.9 million for the corresponding period last year. The increase in revenue for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 benefited from incremental revenues from the StreetLight acquisition (owned for the full period in fiscal 2023) and the startup of new programs previously won in fiscal 2022. Foreign currency translation impacts on revenue were not significant for either period.Operating profit for the segment was $12.0 million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022, a decrease of $11.1 million, or 48.2%, from $23.1 million, for the corresponding period last year. The decrease in operating profit for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was primarily driven by unfavorable impacts of changes in overhead billing rates during the current year quarter of 2023 vs. the prior year quarter mainly in our cyber intelligence market. Impacts on operating profit from foreign currency were not significant for either period.PA ConsultingThree Months EndedDecember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Revenue$282,043\\u00a0$289,974\\u00a0Operating Profit$51,027\\u00a0$63,071\\u00a0Revenues for the PA Consulting segment for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 were $282.0 million, a decrease of $7.9 million, or 2.7%, from $290.0 million for the corresponding period last year. The decrease in revenue for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was driven by foreign currency translation which had a $41.6 million unfavorable impact on revenues in our international businesses for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022, and a favorable impact of $5.3\\u00a0million for the corresponding prior year quarter. In local currency (primarily GBP), PA Consulting experienced an approximate 10% increase in revenues as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher volumes in PA Consulting's existing business for previously delayed projects in fiscal 2022.Operating profit for the segment for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was $51.0 million, a decrease of $12.0 million, or 19.1%, from $63.1 million, for the corresponding period last year, with the decrease partly due to unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts in our international business of $6.9 million as compared to $1.0\\u00a0million in favorable impact in the corresponding prior year period. Additionally, operating profit was impacted by lower utilization as compared to the prior year quarter. Other Corporate Expenses Other corporate expenses for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 were $93.7 million, a decrease of $11.7 million from $105.4 million for the corresponding period last year. This decrease during the three month period was primarily driven by approximately $15.0 million in net favorable impacts from overhead cost reductions associated mainly with one-time benefit program changes, while partly offset by higher incentive and other compensation charges and higher investments in company technology platforms.Included in other corporate expenses are costs and expenses which relate to general corporate activities as well as corporate-managed benefit and insurance programs. Such costs and expenses include: (i) those elements of SG&A expenses relating to the business as a whole; (ii) those elements of our incentive compensation plans relating to corporate personnel whose other compensation costs are not allocated to the LOBs; (iii) the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations; (iv) the quarterly variances between the Company\\u2019s actual costs of certain of its self-insured integrated risk and employee benefit programs and amounts charged to the LOBs; and (v) certain adjustments relating to costs associated with the Company\\u2019s international defined benefit pension plans. In addition, other corporate expenses may also include from time to time certain adjustments to contract margins (both positive and negative) Page 41associated with projects, as well as other items, where it has been determined that such adjustments are not indicative of the performance of the related LOB.Restructuring and Other ChargesSee Note 16- Restructuring and Other Charges for information on the Company\\u2019s activity relating to restructuring and other charges.Backlog InformationWe include in backlog the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. Our policy with respect to Operations & Maintenance (\\\"O&M\\\") contracts, however, is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year, regardless of the remaining life of the contract. For national government programs (other than national government O&M contracts, which are subject to the same policy applicable to all other O&M contracts), our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, excluding option periods. Because of variations in the nature, size, expected duration, funding commitments, and the scope of services required by our contracts, the timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues can vary greatly between individual contracts. Consistent with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client, including our U.S. government work. While management uses all information available to determine backlog, at any given time our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein. Backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues.Because certain contracts (e.g., contracts relating to large Engineering, Procurement & Construction (\\\"EPC\\\") projects as well as national government programs) can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award, and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over several fiscal quarters (and sometimes over fiscal years), we have presented our backlog on a year-over-year basis, rather than on a sequential, quarter-over-quarter basis.The following table summarizes our backlog at December\\u00a030, 2022 and December\\u00a031, 2021 (in millions):December 30, 2022December 31, 2021Critical Mission Solutions$7,632\\u00a0$7,525\\u00a0People & Places Solutions17,243\\u00a016,930\\u00a0Divergent Solutions3,077\\u00a03,275\\u00a0PA Consulting306\\u00a0276\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Total$28,258\\u00a0$28,006\\u00a0The increase in backlog in Critical Mission Solutions (CMS) from December\\u00a031, 2021 was primarily driven by new business awards in the U.S. government space and nuclear remediation sectors offsetting slower growth in the U.S. Defense market.The increase in backlog in People & Places Solutions (P&PS) from December\\u00a031, 2021 was primarily driven by new business awards in our federal, environmental and advanced facilities business.The decrease in backlog in Divergent Solutions (DVS) from December\\u00a031, 2021 was primarily driven by delays of new awards because of continuing resolution throughout fiscal 2022. The increase in backlog in PA Consulting from December\\u00a031, 2021 was primarily driven by strategic focus on long-term projects as well as organic year over year growth of the business.Page 42Consolidated backlog differs from the Company\\u2019s remaining performance obligations as defined by ASC 606 primarily because of our national government contracts (other than national government O&M contracts). Our policy is to generally include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded excluding the option periods while our remaining performance obligations represent a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Additionally, the Company includes our proportionate share of backlog related to unconsolidated joint ventures which is not included in our remaining performance obligations.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt December\\u00a030, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.21 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $637.9 million of available borrowing capacity under our $2.25 billion revolving credit agreement (the \\\"Revolving Credit Facility\\\"). We finance much of our operations and growth through cash generated by our operations.The amount of cash and cash equivalents at December\\u00a030, 2022 represented an increase of $70.6 million from $1.14 billion at September\\u00a030, 2022, the reasons for which are described below. Our net cash flow provided by operations of $302.3 million during the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was unfavorable by $19.3 million in comparison to the cash flow provided by operations of $321.6 million for the corresponding prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in cash from operations is primarily attributable to lower earnings after adjustments for non-cash items compared to the prior period, in addition to a small decrease in working capital performance compared to the prior period.Our net cash used for investing activities for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was $48.7 million, compared to cash used for investing activities of $249.6 million in the corresponding prior year period, with this change due primarily to the acquisition of BlackLynx in the prior year.Our net cash used for financing activities of $246.1 million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 resulted mainly from cash used for share repurchases of $140.5 million, $58.4 million in repurchase of redeemable noncontrolling interests and $29.8 million in dividends to shareholders and $2.3 million in dividends to noncontrolling interest holders, partly offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock of $14.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities in the corresponding prior year period was $144.4 million, due primarily to net proceeds from borrowings of $231.4 million, offset by cash used for repurchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests of $35.1 million and $27.5 million in dividends to shareholders and $14.1 million in net dividends to noncontrolling interest holders.At December\\u00a030, 2022, the Company had approximately $210.0\\u00a0million in cash and cash equivalents held in the U.S. and $1.0\\u00a0billion held outside of the U.S. (primarily in the U.K., the Eurozone, Australia, India, Canada, Israel and the United Arab Emirates), which is used primarily for funding operations in those regions. Other than the tax cost of repatriating funds to the U.S. (see Note 6- Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2022 Form 10-K), there are no material impediments to repatriating these funds to the U.S.The Company had $292.5 million in letters of credit outstanding at December\\u00a030, 2022. Of this amount, $1.3 million was issued under the Revolving Credit Facility and $291.2 million was issued under separate, committed and uncommitted letter-of-credit facilities.On February 6, 2023, the Company refinanced its Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities. See Note 11- Borrowings for further discussion relating to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities following the refinancing.Page 43On February 4, 2022, the Company acquired StreetLight Data, Inc. (\\\"StreetLight\\\"). StreetLight is a pioneer of mobility analytics who uses its data and machine learning resources to shed light on mobility and enable users to solve complex transportation problems. The Company paid total base consideration of approximately $190.8 million in cash, and issued $0.9 million in equity and $5.2 million in in-the-money stock options to the former owners of StreetLight. The Company also paid off StreetLight's debt of approximately $1.0 million simultaneously with the consummation of the acquisition. On November 19, 2021, Jacobs acquired all outstanding shares of common stock of BlackLynx, a provider of high-performance software, to complement Jacobs' portfolio of cyber, intelligence and digital solutions. The Company paid total base consideration of approximately $235.4\\u00a0million in cash to the former owners of BlackLynx. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company also paid off BlackLynx's debt of approximately $5.3\\u00a0million simultaneously with the consummation of the acquisition. We believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our projected cash requirements for the next twelve months based on the liquidity provided by our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our borrowing capacity and our continuing cash from operations.

Our reportable segments are Residential Heating & Cooling, Commercial Heating & Cooling, and Refrigeration.  For  additional information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 16 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our fiscal quarterly periods are comprised of approximately 13 weeks, but the number of days per quarter may vary year-over-year. Our quarterly reporting periods usually end on the Saturday closest to the last day of March, June and September. Our fourth quarter and fiscal year ends on December 31, regardless of the day of the week on which December 31 falls.  For convenience, throughout this Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the 13-week periods comprising each fiscal quarter are denoted by the last day of the respective calendar quarter.We sell our products and services through a combination of direct sales, distributors and company-owned parts and supplies stores. The demand for our products and services is seasonal and significantly impacted by the weather.  Warmer than normal summer temperatures generate demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services, and colder than normal winter temperatures have a similar effect on heating products and services.  Conversely, cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress the demand for HVACR products and services.  In addition to weather, demand for our products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors, such as interest rates, the availability of financing, regional population and employment trends, new construction, general economic conditions, and consumer spending habits and confidence.  A substantial portion of the sales in each of our business segments is attributable to replacement business, with the balance comprised of new construction business.The principal elements of cost of goods sold are components, raw materials, factory overhead, labor, estimated warranty costs, and freight and distribution costs.  The principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, copper and aluminum.  In recent years, pricing volatility for these commodities and related components, including the impact of newly imposed tariffs on the import of certain of our raw materials and components, has impacted us and the HVACR industry in general.  We seek to mitigate the impact of volatility in commodity prices through a combination of price increases, commodity contracts, improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives. We also partially mitigate volatility in the prices of these commodities by entering into futures contracts and fixed forward contracts.\\u00a0\\u00a0Marshalltown TornadoOn July 19, 2018, our manufacturing facility in Marshalltown, Iowa was damaged by a tornado.  Insurance covers the repair or replacement of our assets that suffered damage or loss, and we are working closely with our insurance carriers and claims adjusters to ascertain the amount of insurance recoveries due to us as a result of the damage and loss we suffered. Our insurance 36policies also provide business interruption coverage, including lost profits, and reimbursement for other expenses and costs that have been incurred relating to the damages and losses suffered.  In the third quarter of 2019, we incurred expenses of $3 million related to damages caused by the tornado, which included site clean-up and demolition, factory inefficiencies, freight to move product to other warehouses and sales and marketing promotional costs.  We received insurance recoveries of $10 million in the third quarter of 2019 and allocated the first $2 million of these proceeds to cover our expenses and rebuilding costs incurred during the quarter and allocated the remaining $8 million for lost profits.  These amounts are included in (Gain) loss from insurance recoveries, net of losses incurred in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we expect to receive insurance proceeds of $94 million related to lost profits and $154 million to fund the reconstruction of the facility and as reimbursement for other losses and expenses expected to be incurred. We expect to receive a cumulative total of $121 million in insurance proceeds related to lost profits and a cumulative total of $251 million to fund the reconstruction of the facility and as reimbursement for other losses and expenses expected to be incurred.Financial OverviewResults for the third quarter of 2019 were driven by year over year sales and profit growth in our Residential Heating & Cooling and Commercial Heating & Cooling segments.  The Residential Heating & Cooling segment saw a 7% increase in net sales primarily on higher volumes and their segment profit was up $14 million, including the impact of insurance proceeds received for lost profits.  The Commercial Heating & Cooling segment had a 7% increase in net sales and a $2 million increase in segment profit which were driven by higher volumes and higher price and mix.  Sales in our Refrigeration segment decreased by 28%  primarily due to the sale of our South America and Kysor Warren businesses in prior quarters, and segment profit declined $5 million.  Financial Highlights \\u2022Net sales increased $3 million to $1,033 million in the third quarter of 2019.  Growth in our Residential Heating & Cooling and Commercial Heating & Cooling segments were offset by a sales decline in our Refrigeration segment due to the sale of our South America and Kysor Warren businesses in prior quarters.  \\u2022Operating income in the third quarter of 2019 increased $12 million to $157 million due primarily to insurance proceeds for lost profits related to the Marshalltown tornado.\\u2022Net income for the third quarter of 2019 increased $7 million to $115 million.  \\u2022Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.94 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2.65 per share in the third quarter of 2018.\\u2022For the nine months ended September\\u00a030, 2019, we returned $81 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased $400 million of common stock.

Higher sales volume across all of our segments contributed 4% and favorable combined price and mix in our Residential Heating & Cooling and Commercial Heating & Cooing segments contributed 1%.  These were partially offset by a 5% decline related to the loss of sales related to our South America and Kysor Warren businesses.Gross Profit Gross profit margin in the third quarter of 2019 decreased to 28.9% compared to 29.3% in the third quarter of 2018.  We saw decreases in profit margin of 150 basis points (\\\"bps\\\") from lower factory efficiency and higher other product costs, and 70 bps from higher freight and distribution costs.  Partially offsetting these decreases were positive margin increases of 40 bps from favorable price and mix, 40 bps from sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, 20 bps from lower commodity costs, 10 bps from favorable product warranty costs, and 70 bps from the divested South America and Kysor Warren businesses which had lower margins. Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A declined $6 million to $143 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $149 million in the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to the sale of our South America and Kysor Warren businesses.  As a percentage of net sales, SG&A decreased 60 bps to 13.9% primarily due to a decline in SG&A from our divested business and lower short-term and long-term incentive compensation costs. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Losses (Gains) and Other Expenses, NetLosses (gains) and other expenses, net for the third quarter of 2019 and 2018 included the following (in millions):\\u00a0For the Three Months Ended September 30,\\u00a02019\\u00a02018Realized losses (gains) on settled future contracts $0.1\\u00a0$0.2Foreign currency exchange gains(0.3)\\u00a00.1Other operating (gains) losses(1.2)\\u00a0\\u2014Net change in unrealized losses (gains) on unsettled futures contracts 0.1\\u00a00.2Special legal contingency charges 0.3\\u00a00.1Asbestos-related litigation 1.5\\u00a01.4Environmental liabilities 1.1\\u00a00.2Other items, net 0.6\\u00a00.5Losses (gains) and other expenses, net (pre-tax)$2.2\\u00a0$2.7The net change in unrealized losses (gains) on unsettled futures contracts was due to changes in commodity prices relative to the unsettled futures contract prices.  For more information on our futures contracts, see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  For more information on special legal contingency charges and asbestos-related litigation, see Note 7 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The environmental liabilities relate to estimated remediation costs for contamination at some of our facilities.  Refer to Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the divestiture costs. Restructuring ChargesRestructuring charges were $6 million in the third quarter of 2019 and primarily related to activities to re-align resources and the product portfolio in our Commercial Heating & Cooling and Corporate segments.  For additional information on our restructuring activities, refer to Note 13 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.38Loss on Sale of BusinessesWe recognized a loss of $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2019 related to the sale of our Kysor Warren business.  Refer to Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Income from Equity Method InvestmentsWe participate in two joint ventures that are engaged in the manufacture and sale of compressors, unit coolers and condensing units. We exert significant influence over these affiliates based upon our ownership, but do not control them due to venture partner participation.  Accordingly, these joint ventures have been accounted for under the equity method and their financial position and results of operations are not consolidated.  Income from equity method investments of $3 million in the third quarter of 2019 increased $1 million compared to the third quarter of 2018 on improved operating performance of the joint ventures.  Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net of $13 million in the third quarter of 2019 was up from $10 million in the third quarter of 2018 due to an increase in our average net borrowings.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate increased to 20.2% for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 19.3% for the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to the recording of unrecognized tax benefits.  We expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 22% and 23%, excluding the impact of excess tax benefits recorded as a reduction of income taxes under ASU No. 2016-09.Third Quarter of 2019 Compared to Third Quarter of 2018 - Results by SegmentResidential Heating & Cooling The following table presents our Residential Heating & Cooling segment's net sales and profit for the third quarter of 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\\u00a0For the Three Months Ended September 30,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a02019\\u00a02018\\u00a0Difference\\u00a0% ChangeNet sales$637.6\\u00a0$594.7\\u00a0$42.9\\u00a07.2%Profit$126.5\\u00a0$113.0\\u00a0$13.5\\u00a011.9%% of net sales19.8%\\u00a019.0%\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Net sales increased 7% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018.

For additional information, refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net of $37 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased from $29 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to an increase in our average net borrowings.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate declined to 19.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 21.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.\\u00a042Year-to-Date through September 30, 2019 Compared to Year-to-Date through September 30, 2018 - Results by SegmentResidential Heating & Cooling The following table presents our Residential Heating & Cooling segment's net sales and profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\\u00a0For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a02019\\u00a02018\\u00a0Difference\\u00a0% ChangeNet sales$1,792.2\\u00a0$1,764.4\\u00a0$27.8\\u00a01.6%Profit$366.6\\u00a0$317.9\\u00a0$48.7\\u00a015.3%% of net sales20.5%\\u00a018.0%\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Net sales increased 2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to higher combined price and mix.Segment profit increased $49 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to $74 million of insurance proceeds for lost profits related to the Marshalltown tornado, $33 million of favorable price and mix, $11 million of sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, and $1 million of higher equity method income.  Partially offsetting these increases is $25 million of higher freight and distribution expenses, $11 million of higher SG&A, $9 million from lower factory efficiency, $8 million of higher commodity costs, $7 million of lower sales volume, $8 million of higher other product costs, $1 million of higher tariffs on imported Chinese components, and $1 million of unfavorable foreign exchange rates.Commercial Heating & CoolingThe following table presents our Commercial Heating & Cooling segment's net sales and profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\\u00a0For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a02019\\u00a02018\\u00a0Difference\\u00a0% ChangeNet sales$687.9\\u00a0$668.1\\u00a0$19.8\\u00a03.0\\u00a0%Profit$116.0\\u00a0$117.6\\u00a0$(1.6)\\u00a0(1.4)%% of net sales16.9%\\u00a017.6%\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Net sales increased 3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to 4% higher combined price and mix partially offset by 1% lower sales volume.\\u00a0Segment profit decreased $2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to $7 million of higher other product costs, $5 million from lower factory efficiency, $5 million of higher commodity costs, $4 million of higher freight and distribution expense, $4 million of higher SG&A expense, $3 million of lower sales volume, and $2 million of higher tariffs on Chinese imports.  Partially offsetting these decreases was $23 million of higher price and mix combined, $4 million of sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, and $1 million of higher equity method income.43Refrigeration The following table presents our Refrigeration segment's net sales and profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\\u00a0For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a02019\\u00a02018\\u00a0Difference\\u00a0% ChangeNet sales$442.1\\u00a0$607.9\\u00a0$(165.8)\\u00a0(27.3)%Profit$47.3\\u00a0$57.1\\u00a0$(9.8)\\u00a0(17.2)%% of net sales10.7%\\u00a09.4%\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Net sales decreased 27% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018.  The loss of sales from our divested Australia, New Zealand, Asia, South America and Kysor Warren businesses contributed 27% and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates contributed 1%, partially offset by 1% favorable combined price and mix.Segment profit in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased $10 million due to $4 million of lower profit due to the divested Australia, New Zealand, Asia, South America and Kysor Warren businesses, $3 million of higher commodity costs, $3 million of lower European refrigerant allocation sales, $2 million from lower factory efficiency, $2 million of higher tariffs on Chinese imports, $2 million of higher other product costs, $1 million of higher SG&A expense, $1 million of higher freight and distribution expense, and $1 million of lower equity method income.  Partially offsetting these declines was $5 million of sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, $3 million of higher combined price and mix, and $1 million of higher sales volume.Corporate and OtherCorporate and other expenses decreased $8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to lower short-term and long-term incentive compensation.Liquidity and Capital Resources Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through internally generated funds, bank lines of credit and an asset securitization arrangement.  Working capital needs are generally greater in the first and second quarters due to the seasonal nature of our business cycle.Statement of Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\\u00a0For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\\u00a02019\\u00a02018Net cash provided by operating activities$124.5\\u00a0$231.3Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities(23.1)\\u00a059.3Net cash used in financing activities(102.8)\\u00a0(316.6)Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities - The net cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30,  2019 and 2018 reflects the seasonal increase in working capital requirements. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to the timing of working capital payments and the supply disruption in 2018 caused by the tornado at our Marshalltown facility.Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities - Capital expenditures were $77 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $61 million in the same period of 2018.  Capital expenditures in 2019 were primarily related to the reconstruction of the Marshalltown facility as well as equipment and investments in systems and software to support the overall enterprise.  Net proceeds of $44 million in the first quarter of 2019 were provided by the sale of our Kysor Warren business. We also received $12 million in insurance proceeds to fund the reconstruction of our Marshalltown facility.44Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $103 million compared to $317 million in the same period of 2018.  The decrease in cash used in financing activities is largely due to higher net borrowings on our revolving credit facility partially offset by an increase in share repurchases in 2019 compared to 2018.  We repurchased $400 million of shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $350 million of shares in the same period of 2018.  We also returned $81 million to shareholders through dividend payments in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. For additional information on share repurchases, refer to Note 11 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Debt PositionThe following table details our lines of credit and financing arrangements as of September\\u00a030, 2019 (in millions): \\u00a0Outstanding BorrowingsCurrent maturities of long-term debt:\\u00a0Asset Securitization Program$365.5Capital lease obligations$6.9Domestic credit facility(1)22.5Debt issuance costs(0.6)\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Total current maturities of long-term debt$394.3Long-term debt:\\u00a0Asset Securitization Program (2)\\u2014Capital lease obligations23.7Domestic credit facility(1)685.5Senior unsecured notes350.0Debt issuance costs(2.4)\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Total long-term debt1,056.8Total debt$1,451.1(1) The available future borrowings on our domestic credit facility are $449.5 million after being reduced by the outstanding borrowings and $2.5 million in outstanding standby letters of credit.  We also had $29.6 million in outstanding standby letters of credit outside of the domestic credit facility as of September\\u00a030, 2019.(2) The maximum securitization amount ranges from $225.0 million to $380.0 million, depending on the period.  The maximum capacity of the ASP is the lesser of the maximum securitization amount or 100% of the net pool balance less reserves, as defined under the ASP.Financial LeverageWe periodically review our capital structure to ensure the appropriate levels of leverage and liquidity.  We may access the capital markets, as necessary, based on business needs and to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.  We also evaluate our debt-to-capital and debt-to-EBITDA ratios to determine, among other considerations, the appropriate targets for capital expenditures and share repurchases under our share repurchase programs.  Our debt-to-total-capital ratio increased to 123.6% at September\\u00a030, 2019 from 116.8% at December 31, 2018.   As of September 30, 2019, our senior credit ratings were Baa3 with a stable outlook, and BBB with a stable outlook, by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (\\\"Moody's\\\") and Standard & Poor's Rating Group (\\\"S&P\\\"), respectively.  The security ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.  Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Our goal is to maintain investment grade ratings from Moody's and S&P to help ensure the capital markets remain available to us.LiquidityWe believe our cash and cash equivalents of $46 million, future cash generated from operations and available future borrowings are sufficient to fund operations, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, potential share repurchases and dividends and other needs in the foreseeable future.  Included in our cash and cash equivalents of $46 million as of September\\u00a030, 452019 was $19 million of cash held in foreign locations.  Our cash held in foreign locations is used for investing and operating activities in those locations, and we generally do not have the need or intent to repatriate those funds to the United States.  An actual repatriation in the future from our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be subject to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes. Our expected capital expenditures for 2019 are $100 million, excluding capital expenditures made in conjunction with repair of our Marshalltown facility as those repairs will be covered by insurance.  We also continue to increase shareholder value through the $400 million of share repurchases completed in the nine months ended September 30, 2019.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which the company has: (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us. \\u00a0We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.Commitments, Contingencies and GuaranteesFor information regarding our commitments, contingencies and guarantees, see Note 7 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\",\n          \"Item 2.\\n\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\\nThe following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both MAA and the Operating Partnership, of which MAA is the sole general partner and in which MAA owned a 96.6% interest as of March\\u00a031, 2021.

Revenues for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 increased 1.7% as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, driven by a 1.4% increase in our Same Store segment. Property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 increased by 6.1% as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, driven by a 5.4% increase in our Same Store segment. The drivers of these changes are discussed below in the \\u201cResults of Operations\\u201d section.\\nTrends \\nDuring the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, revenue growth for our Same Store portfolio continued to be favorably impacted by in-place rents and the contribution of average effective rent per unit growth. The average effective rent per unit for our Same Store portfolio continued to increase from the prior year, up 1.3% for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020. Average effective rent per unit represents the average of gross rent amounts, after the effect of leasing concessions, for occupied apartment units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied apartment units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. We believe average effective rent per unit is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing; however, it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit.\\nIn addition, for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, average physical occupancy for our Same Store portfolio was 95.7%, consistent with the average physical occupancy achieved during the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\u00a0\\u00a0Average physical occupancy is a measurement of the total number of our apartment units that are occupied by residents, and it represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the period.\\nAn important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and price points in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. This diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. We believe that a well-balanced portfolio, including both urban and suburban locations, with a broad range of monthly rent price points, will perform well in \\u201cup\\u201d cycles as well as better weather \\u201cdown\\u201d cycles. Through our \\n27\\n\\n\\u00a0\\ninvestment in 36 defined markets, we are diversified across markets, urban and suburban submarkets, and a variety of product types and monthly rent price points.\\nWhile the United States economy continues to recover somewhat from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains disruption from the pandemic and we cannot predict when a full economic recovery will occur. Demand for apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets and is particularly correlated to job growth.\\u00a0\\u00a0Government restrictions implemented in response to the pandemic continue to drive higher than normal unemployment and limit the number of people looking to change their current living situation.\\u00a0\\u00a0While our rent collections in the first quarter of 2021 improved as compared to the rent collections in the fourth quarter of 2020, the current environment could contribute to lower than normal rent collections going forward and continue to suppress demand for apartments, likely driving rent growth on new leases and renewals lower than it would be in a more robust economic environment. Current elevated supply levels could further affect rent growth for our portfolio, particularly for apartment communities located in urban submarkets.\\u00a0\\u00a0To date, properties in suburban submarkets have been somewhat less impacted by supply, primarily because new development has been less prevalent in those submarkets.\\n\\u00a0\\nMarkets throughout the country have been impacted differently by the pandemic.\\u00a0\\u00a0The individual market economies continue to be at various stages of reopening and we expect them to stay this way for some period. Further, as COVID-19 infections continue to occur in different areas of the country including markets where we operate, we are unable to predict if economies will continue to remain open or if they will be disrupted again in the near future.\\u00a0\\u00a0As we continue to move through this uncertain time, we believe that our portfolio strategy of maintaining a diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and rent price points will serve the company better in this environment than a more concentrated portfolio profile. \\nOur focus during this challenging time has been on working with residents who have been financially impacted by the pandemic on rent payment flexibility. At a portfolio level, we have focused on using our pricing system to maintain strong occupancy. As noted above, average physical occupancy for our Same Store portfolio for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 was 95.7%, which we believe positions us well to manage through the current environment and, hopefully, a further improving economy.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nAccess to the financial markets remains strong, particularly for high credit rated borrowers.\\u00a0\\u00a0We have shown our ability to efficiently raise capital through the debt market since the beginning of the pandemic and believe we could do the same in the equity market as necessary. However, a prolonged disruption of the markets or a decline in credit and financing conditions could negatively affect our ability to access capital necessary to fund our operations or refinance maturing debt.\\nResults of Operations\\nFor the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, we achieved net income available for MAA common shareholders of $46.3 million, a 29.5% increase as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, and total revenue growth of $6.9 million, representing a 1.7% increase in property revenues as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\u00a0\\u00a0The following discussion describes the primary drivers of the increase in net income available for MAA common shareholders for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\nProperty Revenues\\nThe following table reflects our property revenues by segment for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nThree months ended March\\u00a031,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nIncrease\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\u00a0Increase\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nSame Store\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n407,037\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n401,370\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,667\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-Same Store and Other\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n17,968\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n16,728\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1,240\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n7.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n425,005\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n418,098\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n6,907\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1.7\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nThe increase in property revenues for our Same Store segment for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020 was the primary driver of total property revenue growth.\\u00a0\\u00a0The Same Store segment generated a 1.4% increase in revenues for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, primarily the result of average effective rent per unit growth of 1.3% as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\u00a0\\u00a0The increase in property revenues from the Non-Same Store and Other segment for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 as compared to three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020 was primarily the result of increased revenues from recently completed development properties.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n28\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nProperty Operating Expenses\\nProperty operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other operating expenses.

The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 33 basis points in our effective interest rate during the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\u00a0\\u00a0The decrease in our effective interest rate was primarily due to debt retirements subsequent to the first quarter of 2020 and through March\\u00a031, 2021, which were retired with proceeds from unsecured debt issuances with lower effective interest rates over the same period.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nOther non-operating expense for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 was $15.9 million of expense, a decrease of $12.6 million as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by $15.1 million of non-cash expense related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares during the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, compared to the recognition of $27.6 million of non-cash expense related to the adjustment of the embedded derivative during the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\u00a0\\u00a0During the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, we also recognized $1.6 million of non-cash income from unconsolidated limited partnerships in other non-operating expense compared to $0.1 million of non-cash expense from an unconsolidated limited partnership during the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nFunds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations\\nFunds from operations, or FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents net income available for MAA common shareholders (computed in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding gains or losses on disposition of operating properties and asset impairment, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and adjustments for joint ventures. Because noncontrolling interest is added back, FFO, when used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, represents FFO attributable to the Company.\\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for MAA common shareholders or any other GAAP measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity.\\u00a0Management believes that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance, primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. We believe that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. While our calculation of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts\\u2019, or NAREIT\\u2019s, definition, it may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\\n29\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCore FFO represents FFO as adjusted for items that are not considered part of our core business operations such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares, gain or loss on sale of non-depreciable assets, adjustments for gains or losses from unconsolidated limited partnerships, net casualty gain or loss, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, non-routine legal costs and settlements, COVID-19 related costs and mark-to-market debt adjustments. While our definition of Core FFO may be similar to others in the industry, our methodology for calculating Core FFO may differ from that utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Core FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. We believe that Core FFO is helpful in understanding our core operating performance between periods in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.\\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income available for MAA common shareholders to FFO and Core FFO for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, as we believe net income available for MAA common shareholders is the most directly comparable GAAP measure (dollars in thousands):\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nThree months ended March\\u00a031,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNet income available for MAA common shareholders\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n46,271\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n35,726\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization of real estate assets\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n129,752\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n124,846\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nLoss on sale of depreciable real estate assets\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization of real estate assets\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0 of real estate joint venture\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n155\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n152\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1,671\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1,304\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nFFO attributable to the Company\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n177,849\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n162,057\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nLoss from embedded derivative in preferred shares(1)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n15,108\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n27,638\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nLoss on sale of non-depreciable real estate assets\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n376\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n(Gain) loss from unconsolidated limited partnerships, net of tax(1)(2)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(1,284\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n77\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNet casualty loss and other settlement proceeds(3)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2,355\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n847\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nLoss (gain) on debt extinguishment(1)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(1\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-routine legal costs and settlements(1)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(16\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nCOVID-19 related costs(1)(4)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n310\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n196\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nMark-to-market debt adjustments(5)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n83\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(34\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\nCore FFO\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n194,442\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n191,196\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIncluded in \\u201cOther non-operating expense\\u201d in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nFor the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, $1.6 million of gains from unconsolidated limited partnerships are offset by $0.3 million of income tax expense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, we incurred $16.9 million in casualty losses related to winter storm Uri (primarily building repairs, landscaping and asset write-offs).\\u00a0 The majority of the storm costs are expected to be reimbursed through insurance coverage.\\u00a0 A receivable has been recognized in \\u201cOther non-operating expense\\u201d for the amount of the recorded losses that we expect to be recovered.\\u00a0 Additional costs related to the storm that are not expected to be recovered through insurance coverage, along with other unrelated casualty losses and recoveries, are reflected in this adjustment.\\u00a0 The adjustment is primarily included in \\u201cOther non-operating expense\\u201d in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. \\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nNon-recurring additional costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting primarily of additional cleaning supplies, contract labor and COVID-19 related leave. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nIncluded in \\u201cInterest expense\\u201d in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\n\\u00a0\\nCore FFO for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 was $194.4 million, an increase of $3.2 million as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, primarily as a result of an increase in property revenues of $6.9 million, and decreases in interest expense of $3.8 million and property management expenses of $1.7 million.

Revolving Credit Facility & Commercial Paper\\nIn May 2019, MAALP closed on a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or Wells Fargo, and fourteen other banks, which we refer to as the Credit Facility.\\u00a0\\u00a0The Credit Facility replaced our previous unsecured revolving credit facility and includes an expansion option up to $1.5 billion.\\u00a0\\u00a0The Credit Facility bears an interest rate of LIBOR, plus a spread of 0.75% to 1.45% based on an investment grade pricing grid.\\u00a0\\u00a0The Credit Facility matures in May 2023 with an option to extend for two additional six-month periods.\\u00a0\\u00a0As of March\\u00a031, 2021, there was no outstanding balance under the Credit Facility, while $3.4 million of capacity was used to support outstanding letters of credit.\\u00a0\\u00a0The Credit Facility serves as our primary source of short-term liquidity.\\nIn May 2019, MAALP established an unsecured commercial paper program, whereby it can issue unsecured commercial paper notes with varying maturities not to exceed 397 days up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $500.0 million. As of March\\u00a031, 2021, there was $385.0 million outstanding under the commercial paper program. \\nUnsecured Senior Notes\\nAs of March\\u00a031, 2021, we had $3.7 billion of publicly issued unsecured senior notes and $222.0 million of privately placed unsecured senior notes outstanding.\\nSecured Property Mortgages\\nWe maintain secured property mortgages with various life insurance companies.\\u00a0\\u00a0These mortgages are usually fixed rate and can range from five to 30 years in maturity.\\u00a0\\u00a0As of March\\u00a031, 2021, we had $369.6 million of secured property mortgages with a weighted average interest rate of 4.40%. \\n\\u00a0\\nIn February 2021, we retired a $118.6 million mortgage associated with eight apartment communities prior to its June 2021 maturity.\\n\\u00a0\\nFor more information regarding our debt capital resources, see Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nAs of March\\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, we had an ownership interest in a limited liability company that owns one apartment community comprised of 269 units, located in Washington, D.C.\\u00a0\\u00a0We also had ownership interests in two technology-focused limited partnerships as of March\\u00a031, 2021. Our interests in these investments are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest.\\nAs of March\\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any relationships, including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\\u00a0\\u00a0In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\\u00a0\\u00a0As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.\\u00a0\\u00a0We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\\u00a031, 2020, filed with the SEC on February\\u00a018, 2021.\\nInsurance\\nWe carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our apartment communities, with limits of liability we believe are customary within the multifamily apartment industry, to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We also maintain insurance against the risk of direct physical damage to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild any property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.\\nWe renegotiated our insurance programs effective July\\u00a01, 2020. We believe that the current property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations.\\n33\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nInflation\\nOur resident leases at our apartment communities allow for adjustments in the rental rate at the time of renewal, which may enable us to seek rent increases.\\u00a0\\u00a0The majority of our leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nPlease refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\\u00a031, 2020, filed with the SEC on February\\u00a018, 2021, for discussions of our critical accounting policies.\\u00a0\\u00a0During the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, there were no material changes to these policies.\\u00a0\\u00a0For more information on recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material impact on our condensed
