Accordingly, you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the information included in our 2019 Annual Report as well as the unaudited financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.\\nIn addition, the statements and assumptions in this Quarterly Report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 or Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, including, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies and prospects as well as estimates of industry growth for the next quarter and beyond. For important information regarding these forward-looking statements, please see the discussion below under the caption \\u201cCautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements.\\u201d\\nOverview\\nCBRE Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation. References to \\u201cCBRE,\\u201d \\u201cthe company,\\u201d \\u201cwe,\\u201d \\u201cus\\u201d and \\u201cour\\u201d refer to CBRE Group, Inc. and include all of its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise.\\nWe are the world\\u2019s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2019 revenue, with leading global market positions in leasing, property sales, occupier outsourcing and valuations. As of December\\u00a031, 2019, we operated in more than 530 offices worldwide and had more than 100,000 employees, excluding independent affiliates. We serve clients in more than 100 countries.\\nOur business is focused on providing services to real estate occupiers and investors. For occupiers, we provide facilities management, project management, transaction (both property sales and leasing) and consulting services, among others. For investors, we provide capital markets (property sales, mortgage origination, sales and servicing), leasing, investment management, property management, valuation and development services, among others. We provide services under the following brand names: \\u201cCBRE\\u201d (real estate advisory and outsourcing services); \\u201cCBRE Global Investors\\u201d (investment management); \\u201cTrammell Crow Company\\u201d (U.S. development); \\u201cTelford Homes\\u201d (U.K. development) and \\u201cHana\\u201d (enterprise-focused flexible workspace solutions).\\nOur revenue mix has shifted in recent years toward more contractual revenue earned by providing multiple services to occupiers and investors, who increasingly prefer to purchase integrated, account-based services from firms that meet the full spectrum of their needs nationally and globally. We believe we are well-positioned to capture a substantial share of this growing market opportunity. We generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and commissions on transactions. Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses generally involve occupier outsourcing (including facilities and project management), property management, investment management, appraisal/valuation and loan servicing.\\nIn 2019, we generated revenue from a highly diversified base of clients, including more than 90 of the Fortune 100 companies. We have been an S&P 500 company since 2006 and in 2020 we were ranked #128 on the Fortune\\u00a0500. We have been voted the most recognized commercial real estate brand in the Lipsey Company survey for 19 years in a row (including 2020). We have also been rated a World\\u2019s Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute for seven consecutive years (including 2020) and are included in the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index and the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. \\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID\\u201119) global pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 has created a tremendous amount of uncertainty, precipitated a global economic contraction and severely disrupted both business activity and global real estate markets. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, many of our locations and those of our clients remain subject to significant operational limitations intended to stem the spread of COVID\\u201119 and a substantial portion of our employee population continues to work remotely, even in jurisdictions where government stay-at-home orders have been eased. \\n25\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCritical Accounting Policies\\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. A discussion of such critical accounting policies, which include revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes can be found in our 2019 Annual Report. There have been no material changes to these policies as of September 30, 2020.\\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\\nSeasonality\\nHistorically, a significant portion of our revenue has been seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. In a typical year, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities have tended to be lowest in the first quarter, and highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Revenue, earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to year-end. In light of the severe economic dislocations caused by COVID\\u201119, and the resulting uncertainty in the business outlook, the quarterly distribution of financial results in 2020 may not conform with historical patterns.\\nInflation\\nOur commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by inflation. However, to date, we believe that general inflation has not had a material impact upon our operations.\\nItems Affecting Comparability\\nWhen you read our financial statements and the information included in this Quarterly Report, you should consider that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results. We believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future.\\nMacroeconomic Conditions\\nEconomic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly. These include overall economic activity and employment growth, with specific sensitivity to growth in office-based employment; interest rate levels and changes in interest rates; the cost and availability of credit; and the impact of tax and regulatory policies. Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, will negatively affect the performance of our business.\\n26\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCompensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production. As a result, negative effects on our operating margins of difficult market conditions, such as we are currently experiencing with the pandemic, is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. In addition, when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance, and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved. Additionally, our contractual revenue generally has typically increased primarily as a result of growth in our outsourcing business, and we believe this contractual revenue should help offset the negative impacts that macroeconomic deterioration could have on other parts of our business. Nevertheless, adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our consolidated operations and financial condition.\\nFrom 2010 to early 2020, commercial real estate markets had generally been characterized by increased demand for space, falling vacancies, higher rents and strong capital flows, leading to solid property sales and leasing activity. This healthy backdrop changed abruptly in the first quarter of 2020 with the emergence of the COVID\\u201119 pandemic and resultant sharp contraction of economic activity across much of the world. There has been a significant impact on commercial real estate markets, as many property owners and occupiers have put transactions on hold and withdrawn existing mandates, sharply reducing sales and leasing volumes. We expect to see this trend continue, as concerns about a COVID-19 resurgence are high across our major markets. The recovery of real estate markets around the world remained uncertain as of October 2020.\\n\\u00a0\\nCOVID-19 is putting downward pressure on parts of our business and creating larger opportunities in other parts. The severe economic effects of the pandemic continued to weigh heavily on higher-margin property lease and sales revenue in the Advisory Services segment. However, global industrial leasing revenue, fueled by e-commerce, and project management activities for occupier clients were resilient during the third quarter.\\u00a0Also, during the third quarter, our Continental Europe business showed signs of recovery and benefited from our diverse service offering during the period.\\nThe performance of our global real estate services and investment businesses depends on an improvement in macroeconomic conditions, including restored business and consumer confidence, sustained economic growth, solid job creation and, stable, functioning global credit markets.\\nEffects of Acquisitions\\nWe historically have made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add and enhance service competencies around the world. On October 1, 2019, we acquired Telford Homes Plc (Telford) to expand our real estate development business outside the United States (Telford Acquisition). A leading developer of multifamily residential properties in the London area, Telford is reported in our Real Estate Investments segment. Telford was acquired for \\u00a3267.1 million, or $328.5 million along with the assumption of $110.7 million (\\u00a390.0 million) of debt and the acquisition of cash from Telford of $7.9 million (\\u00a36.4 million). The Telford Acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\\nStrategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in strengthening our service offerings. The companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform, or independent affiliates in which, in some cases, we held a small equity interest. During 2019, we completed eight in-fill acquisitions: a leading advanced analytics software company based in the United Kingdom, a commercial and residential real estate appraisal firm headquartered in Florida, our former affiliate in Omaha, a project management firm in Australia, a valuation and consulting business in Switzerland, a leading project management firm in Israel, a full-service real estate firm in San Antonio with a focus on retail, office, medical office and land, and a debt-focused real estate investment management business in the United Kingdom. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we acquired leading local facilities management firms in Spain and Italy, a U.S. firm that helps companies reduce telecommunications costs, a leading provider of workplace technology project management, consulting and procurement services to occupiers across the U.S. and a firm specializing in performing real estate valuations in South Korea.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n27\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nWe believe strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position \\u2013 or expand our capabilities \\u2013 within targeted markets or business lines. In general, however, most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating income and net income as a result of transaction-related expenditures, including severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, as well as costs and charges associated with integrating the acquired business and integrating its financial and accounting systems into our own.\\nOur acquisition agreements often require us to pay deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments, subject to the acquired company achieving certain performance metrics, and/or the passage of time as well as other conditions. As of September 30, 2020, we have accrued deferred consideration totaling $89.7 million, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\\nInternational Operations\\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID\\u201119 global pandemic on business conditions across all regions worldwide. COVID\\u201119 has significantly impacted our operations and has the potential to further reduce our business activity. In addition, we continue to monitor developments related to the United Kingdom\\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) and the uncertainty of the long-term economic and trade relationship between the United Kingdom and European Union. The continued uncertainty has the potential to impact our businesses in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, particularly sales and leasing activity in the United Kingdom. Any currency volatility associated with COVID\\u201119, Brexit or other economic dislocations could also impact our results of operations. \\nAs we continue to increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our Real Estate Investments business has a significant amount of euro-denominated assets under management, or AUM, as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe. In addition, our Global Workplace Solutions business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies, such as the euro and the British pound sterling. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our AUM, revenue and earnings.\\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2020, approximately 43.1% of our business was transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies, the majority of which included the Australian dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar and Swiss franc.

39 currencies comprise 7.1% and 6.8% of our revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, and approximately 38 currencies comprise 6.8% and 6.9% of our revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively.\\n\\u00a0\\n28\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nAlthough we operate globally, we report our results in U.S. dollars. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results. For example, we estimate that had the British pound sterling-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the net impact would have been a decrease in pre-tax income of $1.1 million. Had the euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $6.0 million. These hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into U.S. dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10% change in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations.\\nDue to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. Our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which affect the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. We routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.\\n29\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nResults of Operations\\nThe following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended

revenue and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measurements under GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We generally use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. We believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\\n30\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nFee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients. We believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the company\\u2019s overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients, and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business.\\nEBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and asset impairments. Amounts shown for adjusted EBITDA further remove (from EBITDA) the impact of costs associated with transformation initiatives, certain carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue, fair value adjustments to real estate assets acquired in the Telford Acquisition (purchase accounting) that were sold in the period, costs incurred related to legal entity restructuring, integration and other costs related to acquisitions, costs associated with workforce optimization efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and costs associated with our reorganization, including cost-savings initiatives. We believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending.\\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our discretionary use because it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. This measure may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt. We also use adjusted EBITDA as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.\\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows (dollars

during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, management began the implementation of certain transformation initiatives to enable the company to reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. The majority of expenses incurred were cash in nature and primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees. See Note 15 for further discussion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nPrimarily represents costs incurred related to workforce optimization initiated and executed in the second quarter of 2020 as part of management\\u2019s cost containment efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The charges are cash expenditures primarily for severance costs incurred related to this effort. Of the total costs, $7.4 million was included within the \\u201cCost of revenue\\u201d line item and $30.2 million was included in the \\u201cOperating, administrative, and other\\u201d line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.  \\n31\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nPrimarily represents severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with our reorganization announced in the third quarter of 2018 that became effective January 1, 2019.\\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 \\nWe reported consolidated net income of $184.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 on revenue of $5.6 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $256.6 million on revenue of $5.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2019.\\nOur revenue on a consolidated basis for the three months ended September 30, 2020 decreased by $280.0 million, or 4.7%, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019. The revenue decrease reflects the impact of COVID-19 on our Advisory Services segment, which resulted in lower sales (down 34.1%) and leasing revenue (down 31.4%) as well as decreased commercial mortgage origination activity (down 21.2%). These declines were partially offset by higher revenue in our Global Workplace Solutions segment (up 4.7%) led by growth in our facilities management line of business, driven by its contractual nature, and improved revenue in our Real Estate Investments segment (up 31.3%) largely due to the Telford Acquisition. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% positive impact on total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by strength in the Australian dollar, British pound sterling and euro, partially offset by weakness in the Argentine peso, Brazilian real and Indian rupee.\\nOur cost of revenue on a consolidated basis decreased by $122.8 million, or 2.6%, during the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by lower commission expense. Our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our sales and lease revenue performance. Accordingly, the decrease in advisory sales and leasing revenue as a result of COVID-19 led to a corresponding decrease in commission expense. Lower bonuses in our Advisory Services segment attributable to lower revenue as a result of COVID-19 also contributed to the variance. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% negative impact on total cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020. These items were largely offset by higher costs associated with our Global Workplace Solutions segment. We also incurred $15.7 million of costs (primarily employee separation benefits) related to certain transformation initiatives implemented by the company in the third quarter of 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased to 80.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from 79.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by our mix of revenue, with revenue from our Global Workplace Solutions segment, which has a lower margin than our other revenue streams, comprising a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior year period.\\nOur operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis decreased by $15.4 million, or 1.9%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The negative impact of COVID-19 on our operating results led to a corresponding decrease in compensation expense for equity awards. In addition, we reduced general business operating expenses such as travel and entertainment, marketing and employee events to improve financial performance for the three months ended September 30, 2020. These items were partially offset by an increase in certain costs as a result of COVID-19, including higher bad debt expense. We also incurred $39.7 million of costs, primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees, as management commenced the implementation of certain transformation initiatives during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 to enable the company to prospectively reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. Additionally, investments were made in both people and technology associated with efforts to remediate material weaknesses in our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region of our Global Workplace Solutions segment. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.9% negative impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2020. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 14.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from 13.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, primarily attributable to our Advisory Services segment. \\nOur depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $16.2 million, or 14.5%, during the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to a rise in depreciation expense of $15.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2020 driven by technology-related capital expenditures.\\n32\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nOur gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was $52.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which was a substantial increase over the prior year period. These gains resulted from property sales within our Real Estate Investments segment.\\nOur equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $6.6 million, or 25.5%, during the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by higher equity earnings in our investment management line of business within our Real Estate Investments segment, partially offset by lower equity earnings in our Advisory Services segment.\\nOur consolidated interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $4.0 million, or 18.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. This was primarily due to lower interest expense on borrowings associated with our credit agreement (driven by lower interest rates) as well as reduced net interest expense overseas associated with cash pooling arrangements. \\nOur provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $49.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to $63.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease of $14.4 million was primarily related to the corresponding decrease in our consolidated pre-tax book income. Our effective tax rate increased to 21.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from 19.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to a larger impact on a percentage basis of unfavorable permanent book tax differences in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions due to lower pre-tax book income. \\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 \\nWe reported consolidated net income of $438.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on revenue of $16.9 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $644.7 million on revenue of $16.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.\\nOur revenue on a consolidated basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased by $141.0 million, or 0.8%, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The revenue increase reflects higher revenue in our Global Workplace Solutions segment (up 10.2%) led by growth in our facilities management line of business, driven by its contractual nature, and improved revenue in our Real Estate Investments segment (up 31.1%) largely due to the Telford Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue in our Advisory Services segment due to the impact of COVID-19, including lower sales (down 26.1%) and leasing revenue (down 25.6%) as well as decreased commercial mortgage origination activity (down 17.0%). Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by weakness in the Australian dollar, Argentine peso, Brazilian real and Indian rupee, partially offset by strength in the British pound sterling.\\nOur cost of revenue on a consolidated basis increased by $521.6 million, or 4.0%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our Global Workplace Solutions segment and higher costs in our Real Estate Investments segment due to the Telford Acquisition. We also incurred $15.7 million of costs (primarily employee separation benefits) related to certain transformation initiatives implemented by the company in the third quarter of 2020. These items were partially offset by lower commission expense incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. As previously mentioned, our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our sales and lease revenue performance. Accordingly, the decrease in advisory sales and leasing revenue led to a corresponding decrease in commission expense. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% positive impact on total cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased to 80.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from 78.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by our mix of revenue, with revenue from our Global Workplace Solutions segment, which has a lower margin than our other revenue streams, comprising a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior year period. \\n33\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nOur operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis decreased by $124.8 million, or 5.0%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The negative impact of COVID-19 on our operating results led to corresponding decreases in bonus, compensation expense for equity awards and carried interest expense. In addition, we reduced certain operating expenses such as travel and entertainment, marketing and employee events to improve financial performance. During the first half of 2019, we incurred $47.0 million of costs in connection with our reorganization, which did not recur in the current period. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.6% positive impact on total operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. These items were partially offset by $39.7 million of costs, primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees, as management commenced the implementation of certain transformation initiatives during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 to enable the company to prospectively reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we also incurred higher incremental costs associated with Telford, which we acquired on October 1, 2019 (nine months of operating expenses incurred in 2020 versus $13.3 million of transaction costs incurred pre-acquisition during the nine months ended September 30, 2019), rent expense for our new flexible space offering and higher bad debt expense as a result of COVID-19. We also incurred $30.2 million of costs (mainly severance) primarily related to workforce optimization initiated and executed in the second quarter of 2020 as part of management\\u2019s cost containment efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, in the first half of 2020, we saw an increase in charitable donations largely driven by a sizeable donation by the Company to its COVID-19 Relief Fund. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 13.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from 14.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, reflecting the operating leverage inherent in our business. \\nOur depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $34.0 million, or 10.5%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to a rise in depreciation expense of $34.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 driven by technology-related capital expenditures.\\nOur asset impairments on a consolidated basis totaled $75.2 million and $89.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded $50.2 million of non-cash asset impairment charges in our Global Workplace Solutions segment and a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $25.0 million in our Real Estate Investments segment. As a result of the recent global economic disruption and uncertainty due to COVID\\u201119, we deemed there to be triggering events in the first quarter of 2020 that required testing of certain assets for impairment at that time. Based on these tests, we recorded the aforementioned non-cash impairment charges, which were driven by lower anticipated cash flows in certain businesses directly resulting from a downturn in forecasts as well as increased forecast risk due to COVID\\u201119. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we recorded a non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of $89.0 million in our Real Estate Investments segment. This non-cash write-off resulted from a review of the anticipated cash flows and the decrease in assets under management in our public securities business driven in part by continued industry-wide shift in investor preference for passive investment programs.\\nOur gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis increased by $55.9 million, or 290.0%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. These gains resulted from property sales within our Real Estate Investments segment.\\nOur equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis decreased by $47.7 million, or 39.7%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by lower equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our Real Estate Investments segment.\\nOur consolidated interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $15.8 million, or 23.4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. This was primarily due to lower interest expense on borrowings associated with our credit agreement (driven by lower interest rates) as well as reduced net interest expense overseas associated with cash pooling arrangements. \\nOur write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. These costs were incurred in connection with the refinancing of our credit agreement.\\n34\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nOur provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $119.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to $169.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease of approximately $50.9 million was primarily related to the corresponding decrease in consolidated pre-tax book income. Our effective tax rate increased to 21.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from 20.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to a larger impact on a percentage basis of unfavorable permanent book tax differences in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions due to lower pre-tax book income. On March\\u00a027, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in the United States in response to the COVID\\u201119 pandemic. The CARES Act has not had, nor is it expected to have, a significant impact on our effective tax rate for 2020.\\nSegment Operations \\nWe organize our operations around, and publicly report our financial results on, three global business segments: (1) Advisory Services; (2) Global Workplace Solutions; and (3) Real Estate Investments.

during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, management began the implementation of certain transformation initiatives to enable the company to reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. The majority of expenses incurred were cash in nature and primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees. See Note 15 for further discussion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nPrimarily represents costs incurred related to workforce optimization initiated and executed in the second quarter of 2020 as part of management\\u2019s cost containment efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The charges are cash expenditures primarily for severance costs incurred related to this effort. Of the total costs, $6.1 million was included within the \\u201cCost of revenue\\u201d line item and $21.3 million was included in the \\u201cOperating, administrative, and other\\u201d line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nPrimarily represents severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with our reorganization announced in the third quarter of 2018 that became effective January 1, 2019.\\n36\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2019\\nRevenue decreased by $486.5 million, or 21.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019. The revenue decrease primarily reflects the impact of COVID-19, which resulted in lower sales and leasing revenue as well as decreased commercial mortgage origination activity. Foreign currency translation had a 0.4% positive impact on total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by strength in the British pound sterling and euro, partially offset by weakness in the Brazilian real.\\nCost of revenue decreased by $284.0 million, or 20.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to reduced commission expense resulting from lower sales and leasing revenue as a result of COVID-19. Lower bonuses attributable to lower revenue as a result of COVID-19 also contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by $11.8 million of costs (primarily employee separation benefits) related to certain transformation initiatives implemented by the company in the third quarter of 2020. In addition, foreign currency translation had a 0.5% negative impact on total cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was relatively consistent at 61.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 versus 61.1% for the same period in 2019.\\nOperating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $50.7 million, or 9.6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019. The negative impact of COVID-19 on our operating results led to corresponding decreases in bonus and compensation expense for equity awards. In addition, to improve financial performance, we reduced certain operating expenses such as travel and entertainment, marketing, employee events and costs for 3rd party consultants. A reduction to general business operating expenses such as timing for our E&O insurance premium expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020, also contributed to the decline. These items were partially offset by an increase in certain costs as a result of COVID-19, including higher bad debt expense. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.5% negative impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2020. We also incurred $26.5 million of costs, primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees, as management commenced the implementation of certain transformation initiatives during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 to enable the company to prospectively reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth.\\nIn connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans for which the company retains servicing rights, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the retained mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) on the date the loans are sold. Upon origination of a mortgage loan held for sale, the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights to be retained is included in the forecasted proceeds from the anticipated loan sale and results in a net gain (which is reflected in revenue). Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized (within amortization expense) and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. They are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that the servicing income is expected to be received. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, MSRs contributed to operating income $54.5 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $34.0 million of amortization of related intangible assets. For the three months ended September 30, 2019, MSRs contributed to operating income $59.6 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $32.8 million of amortization of related intangible assets.\\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019\\nRevenue decreased by $1.0 billion, or 16.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The revenue decrease primarily reflects the impact of COVID-19, which resulted in lower sales and leasing revenue as well as decreased commercial mortgage origination activity. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by weakness in the Australian dollar, Brazilian real and Indian rupee.\\n37\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCost of revenue decreased by $551.8 million, or 14.7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to reduced commission expense resulting from lower sales and leasing revenue as a result of COVID-19. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.6% positive impact on total cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. These decreases were partially offset by $11.8 million of costs (primarily employee separation benefits) related to certain transformation initiatives implemented by the company in the third quarter of 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 61.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from 60.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.\\nOperating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $121.3 million, or 7.7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The negative impact of COVID-19 on our operating results led to corresponding decreases in bonus and compensation expense for equity awards. In addition, to improve financial performance, we reduced certain operating expenses such as travel and entertainment, marketing and employee events. During the first half of 2019, we incurred $10.5 million of costs in connection with our reorganization, which did not recur in the current period. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.7% positive impact on total operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. These items were partially offset by $26.5 million of costs, primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees, as management commenced the implementation of certain transformation initiatives during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 to enable the company to prospectively reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. We also incurred certain costs as a result of COVID-19, including higher bad debt expense. We also incurred $21.3 million of costs (mainly severance) primarily related to workforce optimization initiated and executed in the second quarter of 2020 as part of management\\u2019s cost containment efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, in the first half of 2020, we saw an increase in charitable donations largely driven by a sizeable donation by the Company to its COVID-19 Relief Fund.\\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2020, MSRs contributed to operating income $127.8 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $96.4 million of amortization of related intangible assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, MSRs contributed to operating income $142.1 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $89.8 million of amortization of related intangible assets.\\n38\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nGlobal Workplace Solutions\\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for our Global Workplace Solutions

during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, management began the implementation of certain transformation initiatives to enable the company to reduce costs, streamline operations and support future

The charges are cash expenditures primarily for severance costs incurred related to this effort. Of the total costs, $1.2 million was included within the \\u201cCost of revenue\\u201d line item and $3.8 million was included in the \\u201cOperating, administrative, and other\\u201d line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nPrimarily represents severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with our reorganization announced in the third quarter of 2018 that became effective January 1, 2019.\\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2019\\nRevenue increased by $166.2 million, or 4.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in our facilities management line of business, which is contractual in nature. Foreign currency translation had a 0.7% positive impact on total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by strength in the British pound sterling and euro, partially offset by weakness in the Argentine peso, Brazilian real and Indian rupee.\\n39\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCost of revenue increased by $120.8 million, or 3.6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, driven by the higher revenue. We also incurred $3.9 million of costs (primarily employee separation benefits) related to certain transformation initiatives implemented by the company in the third quarter of 2020. In addition, foreign currency translation had a 0.7% negative impact on total cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to 92.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from 93.3% for the same period in 2019.\\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased by $19.9 million, or 14.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was largely attributable to $13.2 million of costs, primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees, as management commenced the implementation of certain transformation initiatives during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 to enable the company to prospectively reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. In addition, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, investments were made in both people and technology associated with efforts to remediate material weaknesses in our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. Foreign currency translation also had a 1.4% negative impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2020. These increases were partially offset by a reduction to certain operating expenses, such as travel and entertainment costs, in the third quarter of 2020 as a result of COVID-19. \\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019\\nRevenue increased by $1.0 billion, or 10.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in our facilities management line of business, which is contractual in nature. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by weakness in the Argentine peso, Brazilian real and Indian rupee, partially offset by strength in the British pound sterling.\\nCost of revenue increased by $947.9 million, or 10.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, driven by the higher revenue. We also incurred $3.9 million of costs (primarily employee separation benefits) related to certain transformation initiatives implemented by the company in the third quarter of 2020. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% positive impact on total cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was consistent at 92.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019.\\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased by $9.5 million, or 2.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was largely attributable to $13.2 million of costs, primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees, as management commenced the implementation of certain transformation initiatives during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 to enable the company to prospectively reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. Certain costs were also incurred as a result of COVID-19, including higher bad debt expense, and $3.8 million of costs incurred (mainly severance) primarily related to workforce optimization initiated and executed in the second quarter of 2020 as part of management\\u2019s cost containment efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, investments were also made in both people and technology associated with efforts to remediate material weaknesses in our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. Lastly, in the first half of 2020, we also saw an increase in charitable donations largely driven by a sizeable donation by the Company to its COVID-19 Relief Fund.\\u00a0These increases were partially offset by a reduction to certain operating expenses, such as travel and entertainment costs, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as a result of COVID-19. Additionally, during the first half of 2019, we incurred $36.3 million of costs in connection with our reorganization, which did not recur in the current period.

Foreign currency translation also had a 1.9% negative impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2020.

These increases were partially offset by decreases in acquisition, disposition, incentive and development fees due to the impact of COVID-19. Foreign currency translation had a 0.1% negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by weakness in the euro.\\nCost of revenue was $125.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and was attributable to Telford, thus there is no prior period comparison.\\n42\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nOperating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $13.0 million, or 2.8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The negative impact of COVID-19 on our operating results led to a corresponding decrease in carried interest expense. We also reduced certain operating expenses, such as travel and entertainment costs, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as a result of COVID-19. During the first half of 2019, we also incurred $5.2 million of costs in connection with our reorganization, which did not recur in the current period. These decreases were partially offset by higher incremental costs associated with Telford, which we acquired on October 1, 2019 (nine months of operating expenses incurred in 2020 versus $13.3 million of transaction costs incurred pre-acquisition during the nine months ended September 30, 2019) and rent expense for our new flexible space offering for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Foreign currency translation had a negligible impact on total operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\\n\\u00a0\\nA roll forward of our AUM by product type for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 is as follows (dollars in billions):\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nFunds\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nSeparate\\u00a0Accounts\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nSecurities\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at January 1, 2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n40.1\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n64.9\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n7.9\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n112.9\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nInflows\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n4.4\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5.8\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n11.3\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nOutflows\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(1.3\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(6.4\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(1.3\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(9.0\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\nMarket appreciation (depreciation)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(1.4\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(0.9\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(0.7\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at September 30, 2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n44.8\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n62.9\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n6.8\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n114.5\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nWe describe above how we calculate AUM. Also, as noted above, our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nWe believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we incurred $161.9 million of capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions received, which includes approximately $71.7 million related to technology enablement. Due to the uncertainty caused by COVID\\u201119, we expect our 2020 net capital expenditures to be meaningfully lower than initially forecast in our 2019 Annual Report. As of September 30, 2020, we had aggregate commitments of $84.0 million to fund future co-investments in our Real Estate Investments business, $10.4 million of which is expected to be funded in 2020. Additionally, as of September 30, 2020, we are committed to fund $41.0 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our Real Estate Investments business, which we may be required to fund at any time. As of September 30, 2020, we had $2.8 billion of borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate use.\\nWe have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and general investment requirements (including strategic in-fill acquisitions) and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements. In the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months. Given compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production, the negative effect of difficult market conditions is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. In addition, when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance, and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved. We may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments, as we have done in the past, with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we deem attractive. We may also, from time to time in our sole discretion, purchase, redeem, or retire our existing senior notes, through tender offers, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, or otherwise.\\n43\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nAs noted above, we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing. In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable. However, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions.\\nOur long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, are generally comprised of three elements. The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness. If our cash flow is insufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates. We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.\\nThe second long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions. Our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions. As of September 30, 2020, we had accrued $89.7 million ($20.6 million of which was a current liability) of deferred purchase consideration, which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\\nLastly, as described in our 2019 Annual Report, our board of directors has authorized a program for the company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2019, $400.0 million was available for share repurchases under the authorized repurchase program. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we spent $50.0 million to repurchase, through an existing stock repurchase plan entered into pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, 1,050,084 shares of our Class A common stock with an average price paid per share of $47.62. We did not repurchase any of our stock during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and the three months ended September 30, 2020. As of October 29, 2020, we had $350.0 million of capacity remaining under our current stock repurchase program. Our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future stock repurchases with existing cash. We may utilize our stock repurchase program to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program and on a more opportunistic basis if we believe our stock presents a compelling investment compared to other discretionary uses. The timing of future repurchases, and the actual amounts repurchased, will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions and other factors.\\nHistorical Cash Flows\\nOperating Activities \\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $860.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of $685.9 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The company experienced an overall increase in net working capital of approximately $886.7 million, partially offset by lower net income of $211.8 million as compared to the same period in the previous year. The positive impact from net working capital was largely attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable due to a heightened focus on cash collections across our businesses, and lower corporate income tax payments, partially offset by a net decrease to accounts payable and accrued expenses, as well as compensation payable and accrued bonus.\\nInvesting Activities\\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $206.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of $65.2 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was largely driven by lower capital expenditures, greater distributions received from unconsolidated subsidiaries as well as lower contributions to unconsolidated subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This was partially offset by higher amounts paid for in-fill acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. \\n44\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nFinancing Activities\\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $111.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of $59.4 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings of $52.0 million from our revolving credit facility and $43.2 million in lower net contributions received from non-controlling interests for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, partially offset by the impact of $44.1 million in less proceeds used for repurchase of common stock during the current period.\\nIndebtedness\\nOur level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to pay the principal amount of our indebtedness and other obligations when due. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.\\nLong-Term Debt\\nWe maintain credit facilities with third-party lenders, which we use for a variety of purposes. On March 4, 2019, CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE Services) entered into an incremental assumption agreement with respect to its credit agreement, dated October 31, 2017 (such credit agreement, as amended by a December 20, 2018 incremental loan assumption agreement and such March 4, 2019 incremental assumption agreement, the 2019 Credit Agreement), which (i) extended the maturity of the U.S. dollar tranche A term loans under such credit agreement, (ii) extended the termination date of the revolving credit commitments available under such credit agreement and (iii) made certain changes to the interest rates and fees applicable to such tranche A term loans and revolving credit commitments under such credit agreement. The proceeds from the new tranche A term loan facility under the 2019 Credit Agreement were used to repay the $300.0 million of tranche A term loans outstanding under the credit agreement in effect prior to the entry into this 2019 incremental assumption agreement.\\nThe 2019 Credit Agreement is a senior unsecured credit facility. As of September 30, 2020, the 2019 Credit Agreement provided for the following: (1) a $2.8 billion incremental revolving credit facility, which includes the capacity to obtain letters of credit and swingline loans and terminates on March 4, 2024; (2) a $300.0 million incremental tranche A term loan facility maturing on March 4, 2024, requiring quarterly principal payments unless our leverage ratio (as defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement) is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding any such payment date; and (3) a \\u20ac400.0 million term loan facility due and payable in full at maturity on December 20, 2023.\\nOn August\\u00a013, 2015, CBRE Services issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due March\\u00a01, 2026 (the 4.875% senior notes) at a price equal to 99.24% of their face value. The 4.875% senior notes are unsecured obligations of CBRE Services, senior to all of its current and future subordinated indebtedness, but effectively subordinated to all of its current and future secured indebtedness. Interest accrues at a rate of 4.875% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March\\u00a01 and September\\u00a01.\\nOn September\\u00a026, 2014, CBRE Services issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due March\\u00a015, 2025 (the 5.25% senior notes). On December\\u00a012, 2014, CBRE Services issued an additional $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due March\\u00a015, 2025 at a price equal to 101.5% of their face value, plus interest deemed to have accrued from September\\u00a026, 2014. The 5.25% senior notes are unsecured obligations of CBRE Services, senior to all of its current and future subordinated indebtedness, but effectively subordinated to all of its current and future secured indebtedness. Interest accrues at a rate of 5.25% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March\\u00a015 and September\\u00a015.\\n45\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nThe indentures governing our 4.875% senior notes and 5.25% senior notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create or permit liens on assets securing indebtedness, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and enter into consolidations or mergers. In addition, these indentures require that the 4.875% senior notes and the 5.25% senior notes be jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior basis by CBRE Group, Inc. and each domestic subsidiary of CBRE Services that guarantees the 2019 Credit Agreement.\\nOur 2019 Credit Agreement, 4.875% senior notes and 5.25% senior notes are all fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed by us and certain subsidiaries (see Exhibit 22.1 for a listing of all such subsidiary guarantors). Combined summarized financial information for CBRE Group, Inc., (parent); CBRE Services (subsidiary issuer); and the guarantor subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the obligated group), which excludes investment balances in non-guarantor subsidiaries as well as income from consolidated non-guarantor subsidiaries, is as follows (dollars in thousands):\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nSeptember\\u00a030,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nDecember\\u00a031,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2019\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance Sheet Data:\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent assets\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n3,129,883\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,901,618\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNoncurrent assets (1)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5,200,369\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5,610,084\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal assets (1)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n8,330,252\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n8,511,702\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent liabilities\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,915,488\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,893,775\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNoncurrent liabilities\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2,215,211\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2,201,269\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal liabilities\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5,130,699\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5,095,044\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nNine Months Ended September\\u00a030,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2019\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nStatement of Operations Data:\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,410,167\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,626,821\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nOperating income\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n207,270\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n439,104\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNet income\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n188,518\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n447,936\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIncludes $303.1 million and $574.6 million as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, of intercompany loan receivables from non-guarantor subsidiaries.

(now known as TFCF Corporation) (\\u201c21CF\\u201d) of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of FOX to 21CF stockholders (other than holders that were subsidiaries of 21CF) (the \\u201cDistribution\\u201d) in accordance with the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 20, 2018, by and between 21CF and 21CF Distribution Merger Sub, Inc. Following the Distribution, 354 million and 266 million shares of the Company\\u2019s Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \\u201cClass A Common Stock\\u201d), and Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \\u201cClass B Common Stock\\u201d and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the \\u201cCommon Stock\\u201d), respectively, began trading independently on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. In connection with the Distribution, the Company entered into the Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of March 19, 2019 (the \\u201cSeparation Agreement\\u201d), with 21CF, which effected the internal restructuring (the \\u201cSeparation\\u201d) whereby 21CF transferred to FOX a portfolio of 21CF\\u2019s news, sports and broadcast businesses, including FOX News Media (consisting of FOX News and FOX Business), FOX\\u00a0Entertainment, FOX Sports, FOX Television Stations, and sports cable networks FS1, FS2, FOX Deportes and Big Ten Network, and certain other assets, and FOX assumed from 21CF the liabilities associated with such businesses and certain other liabilities. The Separation and the Distribution were effected as part of a series of transactions contemplated by the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 20, 2018, by and among 21CF, The Walt Disney Company (\\u201cDisney\\u201d) and certain subsidiaries of Disney, pursuant to which, among other things, 21CF became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Disney.\\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company entered into several agreements that govern certain aspects of the Company\\u2019s relationship with 21CF and Disney following the Separation. These include the Separation Agreement, a tax matters agreement, a transition services agreement, as well as agreements relating to intellectual property licenses, employee matters, commercial arrangements and a studio lot lease (See Note 1\\u2014Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the 2019 Form 10-K for additional information).\\nManagement\\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of the Company\\u2019s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations.

The FOX Studios lot, located in Los Angeles, California, provides television and film production services along with office space, studio operation services and includes all operations of the facility.\\nOther Business Developments\\nOn November 6, 2019, the Company announced a stock repurchase program providing for the repurchase of $2 billion of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company also announced on November 6, 2019 that it had entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction to repurchase $350 million of Class A Common Stock and that it also intends to promptly repurchase $150 million of Class B Common Stock. At the same time, the Company announced that it had entered into a stockholders agreement by and between the Company and the Murdoch Family Trust pursuant to which the Company and the Murdoch Family Trust have agreed not to take actions that would result in the Murdoch Family Trust and Murdoch family members together owning more than 44% of the outstanding voting power of the shares of Class B Common Stock or would increase the Murdoch Family Trust\\u2019s voting power by more than 1.75% in any rolling twelve-month period. The Murdoch Family Trust would forfeit votes to the extent necessary to ensure that the Murdoch Family Trust and the Murdoch family collectively do not exceed 44% of the outstanding voting power of the Class B shares, except where a Murdoch family member votes their own shares differently from the Murdoch Family Trust on any matter.\\nIn November 2019, the Company announced the entry into an agreement with Nexstar Media Group (\\u201cNexstar\\u201d) to acquire three television stations (FOX-affiliate KCPQ and MyNetworkTV-affiliate KZJO located in Seattle, Washington and FOX-affiliate WITI located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin) for approximately $350 million. As part of this transaction, the Company has agreed to sell Nexstar two television stations located in Charlotte, North Carolina, FOX-affiliate WJZY and MyNetworkTV-affiliate WMYT, for approximately $45 million. Completion of the transaction is expected to occur during the first half of calendar year 2020, subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions.\\nIn October 2019, the Company acquired 67% of the equity in Credible Labs Inc. (\\u201cCredible\\u201d), a U.S. consumer finance marketplace, for approximately A$390 million (approximately $260\\u00a0million) in cash (the \\u201cCredible Acquisition\\u201d). In addition, the Company has agreed to commit up to $75\\u00a0million of capital to Credible over approximately two years following the closing of the Credible Acquisition.\\n22\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nRESULTS

meaningful\\nOverview\\u2014The Company\\u2019s revenues increased 5% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber and higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network, partially offset by the impact of a lower average number of subscribers. The decrease in advertising revenue was primarily due to lower political advertising revenue at FOX Television Stations due to the U.S. midterm elections in November 2018, fewer broadcasts of F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (\\u201cFIFA\\u201d) World Cup events and lower ratings for entertainment programming on the FOX Network, partially offset by higher pricing for entertainment programming and the broadcast of the 71st Annual Primetime Emmy Awards on the FOX Network and increased digital advertising revenue. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher digital content licensing revenue at the FOX Network and revenues generated from the operation of the FOX Studios lot for third parties and from Premier Boxing Champions (\\u201cPBC\\u201d) pay-per-view events.\\nOperating expenses decreased 2% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs at the Cable Network Programming and Television segments. The decrease in sports programming rights amortization and production costs was the result of fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events and the absence of Ultimate Fighting Championship (\\u201cUFC\\u201d) content, partially offset by contractual rate increases for the National Football League (\\u201cNFL\\u201d), Major League Baseball (\\u201cMLB\\u201d), college football and PBC content. Partially offsetting these decreases in operating expenses were higher broadcast costs related to operating as a standalone public company.\\n23\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 18% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher costs in fiscal 2020 related to operating as a standalone public company as compared to allocated costs in fiscal 2019 (See Note 1\\u2014Description of Business and Basis of Presentation to the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of FOX under the heading \\u201cBasis of Presentation\\u201d for additional information). In addition, the three months ended September 30, 2019 includes equity-based compensation costs of approximately $15 million related to the grant of restricted stock units and stock options, in connection with the Distribution, under the Fox Corporation 2019 Shareholder Alignment Plan (See Note 11\\u2014Equity-Based Compensation in the 2019 Form 10-K for additional information).\\nInterest expense\\u2014Interest expense increased $74 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to the issuance of $6.8 billion of senior notes in January 2019 (See Note 9\\u2014Borrowings in the 2019 Form 10-K under the heading \\u201cSenior Notes Issued Under the January 2019 Indenture\\u201d for additional information).\\nInterest income\\u2014Interest income increased $17 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a higher average cash balance.\\nOther, net\\u2014See Note 12\\u2014Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of FOX under the heading \\u201cOther, net.\\u201d\\nIncome tax expense\\u2014The Company\\u2019s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 27% and 26% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes and other permanent items.\\nNet income\\u2014Net income decreased 17% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a decrease in unrealized gains on investments (See Note 12\\u2014Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of FOX under the heading \\u201cOther, net\\u201d) and higher interest expense due to the issuance of $6.8 billion of senior notes in January 2019 (See Note 9\\u2014Borrowings in the 2019 Form 10-K under the heading \\u201cSenior Notes Issued Under the January 2019 Indenture\\u201d for additional information), partially offset by improved Segment EBITDA (as defined below).\\nSegment Analysis \\nThe Company\\u2019s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company\\u2019s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or Segment EBITDA. Due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses.\\nBeginning with the announcement of the Company\\u2019s financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company has renamed as \\u201cSegment EBITDA\\u201d the measure that it previously referred to as \\u201cSegment OIBDA\\u201d. The definition of this measure has not changed: Segment EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, Interest income, Other, net and Income tax expense. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company\\u2019s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company\\u2019s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the Company\\u2019s businesses. \\n24\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nThe following tables set forth the

at the Cable Network Programming segment increased 2% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019. Affiliate fee revenue remained consistent with the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, as higher average rates per subscriber, led by contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals, were offset by the impact of a lower average number of subscribers. The decrease in the average number of subscribers was due to a reduction in subscribers to traditional MVPDs, partially offset by an increase in digital MVPD subscribers. The decrease in advertising revenue was due to lower linear advertising revenue, including the effect of fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events and the absence of UFC content, partially offset by higher digital advertising revenue. The increase in other revenues was primarily attributable to the revenues generated from PBC pay-per-view events and higher sports sublicensing revenue.\\n25\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCable Network Programming Segment EBITDA increased 8% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above and lower expenses. Operating expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2019, primarily due to lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs, including fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events and the absence of UFC content, partially offset by contractual rate increases for MLB and PBC content. Partially offsetting these decreases in operating expenses were higher costs incurred in connection with FOX Nation which was launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.\\nTelevision (51% and 50% of the Company\\u2019s revenues for the first three months of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively)\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nFor\\u00a0the\\u00a0three\\u00a0months\\u00a0ended September 30,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2019\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2018\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nChange\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\u00a0Change\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(in millions, except %)\\n\\n\\n\\nRevenues\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertising\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n787\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n799\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(12\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(2\\n\\n)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nAffiliate fee\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n455\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n398\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n57\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nOther\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n114\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n80\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n43\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal revenues\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1,356\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1,277\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n79\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nOperating expenses\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(943\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(951\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(1\\n\\n)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nSelling, general and administrative\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(162\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(155\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(7\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nSegment EBITDA\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n251\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n171\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n80\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n47\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nRevenues at the Television segment increased 6% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019. The decrease in advertising revenue was primarily due to lower political advertising revenue at the FOX Television Stations due to the U.S. midterm elections in November 2018, fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events and lower ratings for entertainment programming on the FOX Network. Partially offsetting these decreases in advertising revenue were higher pricing for entertainment programming and the broadcast of the 71st Annual Primetime Emmy Awards on the FOX Network, higher ratings for college football and increased digital advertising revenue. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network and higher average rates per subscriber for the Company\\u2019s owned and operated television stations. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher digital content licensing revenue at the FOX Network.\\nTelevision Segment EBITDA increased 47% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above. Expenses remained consistent with the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, as the decrease in operating expenses was offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs principally as a result of fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events, partially offset by contractual rate increases for NFL and college football content. Partially offsetting these decreases in expenses were higher costs related to operating as a standalone public company.\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\nBeginning with the announcement of the Company\\u2019s financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company has renamed as \\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\\u201d the measure that it had previously referred to as \\u201cTotal Segment EBITDA\\u201d and, prior to the announcement of the Company\\u2019s financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, as \\u201cTotal Segment OIBDA.\\u201d The definition of this measure has not changed: Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, Interest income, Other, net and Income tax expense.\\n26\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nManagement believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company\\u2019s Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company\\u2019s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect Net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company\\u2019s business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors\\u2019 data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).\\nAdjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d). In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company\\u2019s financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\\nThe following table reconciles Net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30,

The Company has an unused five-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (See Note 5\\u2014Borrowings to the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of FOX) and has access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions.

Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the United States as measured by number of homes closed. We construct and sell homes through our operating divisions in 91 markets across 29 states, primarily under the names of D.R. Horton, America\\u2019s Builder, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes. Our common stock is included in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \\u201cDHI.\\u201d Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms \\u201cD.R. Horton,\\u201d the \\u201cCompany,\\u201d \\u201cwe\\u201d and \\u201cour\\u201d used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.Our business operations consist of homebuilding, a majority-owned residential lot development company, financial services and other activities. Our homebuilding operations are our core business and primarily include the construction and sale of single-family homes with sales prices generally ranging from $150,000 to more than $1,000,000, with an average closing price of $308,800 during the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021. Approximately 91% of our home sales revenue in the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 was generated from the sale of single-family detached homes, with the remainder from the sale of attached homes, such as townhomes, duplexes and triplexes.Our position as the most geographically diverse and largest volume homebuilder in the United States provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales. Our product offerings include a broad range of homes for entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury buyers across our markets. Our entry-level homes at affordable price points have experienced very strong demand from homebuyers, as this segment of the new home market remains under-served, with low inventory levels relative to demand.During fiscal 2020, we also began constructing and leasing homes as income-producing single-family rental communities. After a rental community is constructed and achieves a stabilized level of leased occupancy, we generally expect to market the community for a bulk sale of homes. These operations are reported in our homebuilding segment. During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, we completed our first sale of a single-family rental community representing 124 homes for $31.8 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $14.0 million. At March\\u00a031, 2021, our homebuilding fixed assets included $182.6 million of assets related to 27 single-family rental communities, and our single-family rental platform included 1,650 homes and finished lots, of which 570 homes were completed.At March\\u00a031, 2021, we owned 64% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group Inc. (Forestar), a publicly traded residential lot development company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \\u201cFOR.\\u201d Forestar is a key part of our homebuilding strategy to enhance operational and capital efficiency and returns by expanding relationships with land developers and increasing the portion of our land and lot position controlled under land purchase contracts. Forestar has made significant investments in land acquisition and development over the last few years to expand its business across the United States.Our financial services operations provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily to our homebuyers and sells substantially all of the mortgages it originates and the majority of the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. DHI Mortgage originates loans in accordance with purchaser guidelines and sells substantially all of its mortgage production shortly after origination. Our 100% owned subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies, examination, underwriting and closing services, primarily related to our homebuilding transactions.31Table of ContentsIn addition to our homebuilding, Forestar and financial services operations, we engage in other business activities through our subsidiaries. We conduct insurance-related operations, construct and own income-producing multi-family rental properties, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate oil and gas related assets. The results of these operations are immaterial for separate reporting and therefore are grouped together and presented as other. Our multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease and own multi-family residential properties that produce rental income. We primarily focus on constructing garden style multi-family communities, which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units, in high growth suburban markets. After we complete construction and achieve a stabilized level of leased occupancy, the property is typically marketed for sale. At March\\u00a031, 2021 and September\\u00a030, 2020, our consolidated balance sheets included $394.4 million and $246.2 million, respectively, of assets related to multi-family rental operations. Total assets related to other business activities were $547.5 million and $379.4 million at March\\u00a031, 2021 and September\\u00a030, 2020, respectively.OVERVIEWFiscal Year-to-Date Operating ResultsDuring the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, the number and value of our net sales orders increased 43% and 53%, respectively, compared to the prior year period. During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, our number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 40% and 44%, respectively, compared to the prior year period, and our consolidated revenues increased 45% to $12.4 billion compared to $8.5 billion in the prior year period. Our pre-tax income was $2.2 billion in the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period, and our pre-tax operating margin was 17.9% compared to 13.4%. Net income was $1.7 billion in the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 compared to $916.4 million in the prior year period.In the trailing twelve months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, our return on equity (ROE) was 27.1% compared to 19.1% in the prior year period, and our homebuilding return on inventory (ROI) was 31.2% compared to 20.2%. ROE is calculated as net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the trailing twelve months divided by average stockholders\\u2019 equity, where average stockholders\\u2019 equity is the sum of ending stockholders\\u2019 equity balances of the trailing five quarters divided by five. Homebuilding ROI is calculated as homebuilding pre-tax income for the trailing twelve months divided by average inventory, where average inventory is the sum of ending homebuilding inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five.Within our homebuilding land and lot portfolio, our lots controlled under purchase contracts represent 75% of the lots owned and controlled at March\\u00a031, 2021 compared to 70% at September\\u00a030, 2020 and 64% at March\\u00a031, 2020. Our relationship with Forestar and expanded relationships with other land developers across the country have allowed us to increase the controlled portion of our lot pipeline.COVID-19During March 2020, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (C-19) and the related widespread reductions in economic activity across the United States began to adversely affect our business. However, residential construction and financial services are designated as essential businesses as part of critical infrastructure in almost all of the municipalities across the U.S. where we operate. We implemented operational protocols to comply with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities.During April 2020 when restrictive stay-at-home orders were in place for many markets across the United States, we experienced increases in sales cancellations and decreased sales orders compared to the prior year. However, as economic activity began to resume and restrictive orders were eased, demand for our homes improved significantly during the remainder of fiscal 2020 and has remained strong throughout the first half of fiscal 2021. We believe the increase in demand has been fueled by historically low interest rates on mortgage loans and the limited supply of homes at affordable price points across most of our markets. We were and remain well-positioned for increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lot supply and housing inventory.We believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide us with the flexibility to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to continue to generate strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and manage our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions.32Table of ContentsSTRATEGYOur operating strategy focuses on enhancing long-term value to our shareholders by leveraging our financial and competitive position in our core homebuilding business to maximize the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows, while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to navigate changing economic conditions and make opportunistic strategic investments. We made operational adjustments as a result of C-19; however, our strategy remains consistent and includes the following initiatives:\\u2022Developing and retaining highly experienced and productive teams of personnel throughout our company that are aligned and focused on continuous improvement in our operational execution and financial performance.\\u2022Maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position and controlling our level of debt.\\u2022Allocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify our geographic risk.\\u2022Offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market.\\u2022Modifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand and maintain affordability.\\u2022Delivering high quality homes and a positive experience to our customers both during and after the sale.\\u2022Managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.\\u2022Investing in land and land development in desirable markets, while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each market relative to the local new home demand.\\u2022Continuing to seek opportunities to expand the portion of our land and finished lots controlled through purchase contracts with Forestar and other land developers across the country.\\u2022Controlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors.\\u2022Improving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales and other key operational activities.\\u2022Controlling our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense infrastructure to match production levels.\\u2022Opportunistically evaluating potential acquisitions to enhance our operations and improve returns.\\u2022Ensuring that our financial services business provides high quality mortgage and title services to homebuyers efficiently and effectively.\\u2022Investing in the construction and leasing of single-family and multi-family rental properties to meet rental demand in high growth suburban markets and selling these properties profitably.We believe our operating strategy, which has produced positive results in recent years, will allow us to successfully operate through changing economic conditions to maintain and improve our financial and competitive position. However, we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful, and we may need to adjust parts of our strategy to meet future market conditions.33Table of ContentsKEY RESULTSKey financial results as of and for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, as compared to the same period of 2020, were as follows:Homebuilding:\\u2022Homebuilding revenues increased 41% to $6.2 billion compared to $4.4 billion.\\u2022Homes closed increased 36% to 19,701 homes, and the average closing price of those homes was $313,200.\\u2022Net sales orders increased 35% to 27,059 homes, and the value of net sales orders increased 47% to $8.8 billion.\\u2022Sales order backlog increased 85% to 35,845 homes, and the value of sales order backlog increased 97% to $11.6 billion.\\u2022Home sales gross margin was 24.6% compared to 21.3%.\\u2022Homebuilding SG&A expense was 7.6% of homebuilding revenues compared to 8.3%.\\u2022Homebuilding pre-tax income was $1.1 billion compared to $565.5 million.\\u2022Homebuilding pre-tax income was 17.0% of homebuilding revenues compared to 12.9%.\\u2022Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.9 billion compared to $2.6 billion and $1.0 billion at September\\u00a030, 2020 and March\\u00a031, 2020, respectively.\\u2022Homebuilding inventories totaled $12.9 billion compared to $11.0 billion and $11.1 billion at September\\u00a030, 2020 and March\\u00a031, 2020, respectively.\\u2022Homes in inventory totaled 46,100 compared to 38,000 and 33,400 at September\\u00a030, 2020 and March\\u00a031, 2020, respectively.\\u2022Owned lots totaled 121,500 compared to 112,600 and 118,700 at September\\u00a030, 2020 and March\\u00a031, 2020, respectively.

The percentage increase resulted from improvements of 320 basis points due to the average selling price of our homes closed increasing by more than the average cost of those homes, 10 basis points from a decrease in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments related to prior year acquisitions, 10 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest, partially offset by increased warranty and construction defect costs of 10 basis points.Gross profit from home sales increased to $2.9 billion in the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 from $1.7 billion in the prior year period and increased 330 basis points to 24.4% as a percentage of home sales revenues. The percentage increase resulted from improvements of 300 basis points due to an increase in the average selling price while the cost of our homes closed decreased slightly, 10 basis points from a decrease in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments related to prior year acquisitions, 10 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and 10 basis points due to a decrease in warranty and construction defect costs.We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. These actions could cause our gross profit margins to fluctuate in future periods. If new home demand declines from current levels, we would expect our gross profit margins to also decline.Land/Lot Sales and Other RevenuesLand/lot sales and other revenues from our homebuilding operations were $17.3 million and $37.2 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, and $15.5 million and $35.2 million in the comparable periods of fiscal 2020. We continually evaluate our land and lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. We generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them. However, some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers.\\u00a0We may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons. As of March\\u00a031, 2021, our homebuilding operations had $24.1 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months.41Table of ContentsInventory and Land Option ChargesAt the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and perform detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary. As of March\\u00a031, 2021, we determined that no communities were impaired, and no impairment charges were recorded during the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021. During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, impairment charges totaled $5.6 million. There were $1.7 million of impairment charges recorded in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.As we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows, we may modify our pricing and incentives, construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment. If the housing market or economic conditions are adversely affected for a prolonged period due to C-19 or otherwise, we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. These evaluations could result in additional impairment charges which could be significant.During the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs related to land purchase contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate were $3.2 million and $5.6 million, respectively, compared to $7.1 million and $10.7 million in the same periods of fiscal 2020.Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) ExpenseSG&A expense from homebuilding activities increased 30% to $469.5 million and 28% to $920.6 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, from $361.8 million and $720.2 million in the prior year periods. SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 7.6% and 7.7% in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to 8.3% and 8.7% in the prior year periods.Employee compensation and related costs represented 81% and 80% of SG&A costs in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to 73% in both prior year periods. These costs increased 44% to $382.3 million and 40% to $738.3 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, from $265.7 million and $527.7 million in the prior year periods. Our homebuilding operations employed 7,916 and 6,987 employees at March\\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively.We attempt to control our SG&A costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations; however, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues.Interest IncurredWe capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. Interest incurred by our homebuilding operations was $22.6 million and $47.0 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to $22.9 million and $47.2 million in the prior year periods. Interest charged to cost of sales was 0.7% and 0.8% of total cost of sales (excluding inventory and land option charges) in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to 0.8% in both prior year periods.Gain on Sale of AssetsDuring the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, we sold one single-family rental community representing 124 homes for $31.8 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $13.1 million in our homebuilding segment and $0.9 million in our other businesses.42Table of ContentsOther IncomeOther income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations was $1.8 million and $3.3 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to $4.1 million and $9.6 million in the prior year periods. Other income consists of interest income and various other types of ancillary income, gains, expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes, land and lots. The activities that result in this ancillary income are not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.Business AcquisitionIn October 2020, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Braselton Homes in Corpus Christi, Texas for approximately $23.0 million in cash. The assets acquired included approximately 90 homes in inventory, 95 lots and control of approximately 840 additional lots through purchase contracts. We also acquired a sales order backlog of approximately 125 homes.43Table of ContentsHomebuilding Results by Reporting Region\\u00a0\\u00a0Three Months Ended March 31,\\u00a020212020\\u00a0HomebuildingRevenuesHomebuildingPre-taxIncome (1)% ofRevenuesHomebuildingRevenuesHomebuildingPre-taxIncome (1)% ofRevenues\\u00a0(In millions)East$861.5\\u00a0$146.0\\u00a016.9\\u00a0%$579.7\\u00a0$73.3\\u00a012.6\\u00a0%Midwest468.4\\u00a060.9\\u00a013.0\\u00a0%308.7\\u00a023.6\\u00a07.6\\u00a0%Southeast2,054.9\\u00a0376.7\\u00a018.3\\u00a0%1,316.7\\u00a0187.8\\u00a014.3\\u00a0%South Central1,504.1\\u00a0266.8\\u00a017.7\\u00a0%1,066.4\\u00a0156.2\\u00a014.6\\u00a0%Southwest243.1\\u00a039.5\\u00a016.2\\u00a0%199.7\\u00a030.8\\u00a015.4\\u00a0%West1,055.7\\u00a0162.2\\u00a015.4\\u00a0%907.6\\u00a093.8\\u00a010.3\\u00a0%$6,187.7\\u00a0$1,052.1\\u00a017.0\\u00a0%$4,378.8\\u00a0$565.5\\u00a012.9\\u00a0%\\u00a0Six Months Ended March 31,\\u00a020212020\\u00a0HomebuildingRevenuesHomebuildingPre-taxIncome (1)% ofRevenuesHomebuildingRevenuesHomebuildingPre-taxIncome (1)% ofRevenues\\u00a0(In millions)East$1,670.7\\u00a0$278.5\\u00a016.7\\u00a0%$1,100.2\\u00a0$133.2\\u00a012.1\\u00a0%Midwest881.5\\u00a0110.1\\u00a012.5\\u00a0%591.3\\u00a042.3\\u00a07.2\\u00a0%Southeast3,833.3\\u00a0682.5\\u00a017.8\\u00a0%2,467.3\\u00a0333.9\\u00a013.5\\u00a0%South Central2,979.0\\u00a0531.5\\u00a017.8\\u00a0%2,025.1\\u00a0288.9\\u00a014.3\\u00a0%Southwest475.7\\u00a078.1\\u00a016.4\\u00a0%410.7\\u00a065.3\\u00a015.9\\u00a0%West2,066.1\\u00a0306.6\\u00a014.8\\u00a0%1,667.2\\u00a0163.5\\u00a09.8\\u00a0%$11,906.3\\u00a0$1,987.3\\u00a016.7\\u00a0%$8,261.8\\u00a0$1,027.1\\u00a012.4\\u00a0%\\u00a0______________(1)Expenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of interest and property taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our corporate office.

In the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, the volume of first-lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers increased 36% and 43%, respectively, from the prior year periods, due to increases in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations of 36% and 40%. In the six month period, a 2% increase in the percentage of homes closed for which DHI Mortgage handled our homebuyers\\u2019 financing also contributed to the increase in loan origination volume.Homes closed by our homebuilding operations constituted 98% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in both the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 compared to 98% and 97%, respectively, in the prior year periods. These percentages reflect DHI Mortgage\\u2019s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations.The number of loans sold increased 41% and 47% in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. Virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on March\\u00a031, 2021 were eligible for sale to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, approximately 54% of our mortgage loans were sold directly to Fannie Mae or into securities backed by Ginnie Mae, and 37% were sold to two other major financial entities. Changes in market conditions could result in a greater concentration of our mortgage sales in future periods to fewer financial entities and directly to Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae, and we may need to make other adjustments to our mortgage operations.Due to the disruption in the secondary mortgage markets beginning in late March 2020 caused by C-19 and the uncertainty of the impact of the CARES Act, many financial entities began offering lower pricing and limiting their purchases of mortgages and servicing rights. As a result of the rapid decline in servicing values at the end of March 2020, we began retaining the servicing rights on a portion of our loan originations. Servicing values have since improved, and we sold a portion of our retained mortgage servicing rights in the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021. We expect to continue retaining some servicing rights prior to selling them to third parties, typically within six months of loan origination.Financial Services Revenues and ExpensesRevenues from our mortgage operations increased 135% to $190.3 million and 112% to $342.7 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, from $80.9 million and $162.0 million in the prior year periods, primarily due to increases of 35% and 42% in loan originations and higher net gains achieved on the sale of loan originations in the secondary market. Revenues from our title operations increased 47% to $34.8 million and 53% to $69.6 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, from $23.6 million and $45.4 million in the prior year periods, primarily due to increases of 41% and 46% in escrow closings.General and administrative (G&A) expense related to our financial services operations increased 44% to $123.7 million and 42% to $233.3 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, from $85.9 million and $163.8 million in the prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to increases in employee related costs to support a higher volume of transactions. Our financial services operations employed 2,578 and 1,934 employees at March\\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively.As a percentage of financial services revenues, G&A expense was 55.0% and 56.6% in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to 82.2% and 79.0% in the prior year periods. Our significant increase in loan volume resulted in better G&A leverage in the current year periods. However, fluctuations in financial services G&A expense as a percentage of revenues can occur because some components of revenue fluctuate differently than loan volumes, and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned.Other income, net of other expense, included in our financial services operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary.As a result of the revenue increases from higher volumes of mortgage originations and escrow closings and better leverage of our G&A expenses, pre-tax income from our financial services operations increased 336% to $107.7 million and 247% to $191.8 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, from $24.7 million and $55.2 million in the prior year periods.50Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - OTHER BUSINESSESThe combined pre-tax income of all of our subsidiaries engaged in other business activities was $0.1 million and $2.3 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to $28.0 million and $57.5 million in the prior year periods. Income generated by our other businesses can vary significantly based on the timing of multi-family rental property sales. There were no multi-family rental properties sold during the current year periods. There were two multi-family rental properties sold during the prior year periods, one in November 2019 and another in February 2020, for a total of $128.5 million with gains on sale totaling $59.4 million.Our multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease and own multi-family residential properties that produce rental income. We primarily focus on constructing garden style multi-family communities, which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units, in high growth suburban markets. After we complete construction and achieve a stabilized level of leased occupancy, the property is typically marketed for sale. At March\\u00a031, 2021, we had eight multi-family rental projects under active construction and four projects that were substantially complete and in the lease-up phase. These 12 projects represent 3,760 multi-family units, including 2,450 units under active construction and 1,310 completed units.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATEDIncome before Income TaxesPre-tax income for the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 was $1.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, compared to $621.3 million and $1.1 billion in the prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to increases in pre-tax income generated by our homebuilding operations as a result of higher revenues from increased home closings and an increase in home sales gross margin.Income TaxesOur income tax expense for the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 was $246.0 million and $485.1 million, respectively, compared to $137.3 million and $228.1 million in the prior year periods. Our effective tax rate was 20.8% and 21.9% for the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 compared to 22.1% and 19.9% in the prior year periods. The effective tax rates for all periods include an expense for state income taxes and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the federal energy efficient homes tax credit. For the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, the retroactive reinstatement of the federal energy efficient homes tax credit reduced our effective tax rate by 2.6%. For the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, a change in the estimate of homes qualifying for the fiscal 2020 retroactive extension of the energy efficient tax credit reduced our effective tax rate by 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.Our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, were $150.2 million at March\\u00a031, 2021 compared to $152.4 million at September\\u00a030, 2020. We have a valuation allowance of $7.4 million and $7.5 million at March\\u00a031, 2021 and September\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, related to state deferred tax assets for net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards that are more likely than not to expire before being realized. We will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state NOL carryforwards. Any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact our effective tax rate.The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets.51Table of ContentsCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYWe have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. Our current levels of cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions.Currently, we are increasing our investments in homebuilding inventories and single-family and multi-family rental properties to expand our operations and grow our revenues and profitability, as well as considering opportunistic strategic investments as they arise. We are also returning capital to our shareholders through dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. We are maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances than in prior years to support the increased scale and level of activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing conditions and opportunities.At March\\u00a031, 2021, our ratio of debt to total capital (notes payable divided by stockholders\\u2019 equity plus notes payable) was 25.7% compared to 26.6% at September\\u00a030, 2020 and 29.2% at March\\u00a031, 2020. Our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital (homebuilding notes payable divided by stockholders\\u2019 equity plus homebuilding notes payable) was 16.8% compared to 17.5% at September\\u00a030, 2020 and 19.2% at March\\u00a031, 2020. Over the long term, we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 35%, and we expect it to remain significantly lower than 35% throughout fiscal 2021. We believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders. We exclude the debt of Forestar and our financial services business because they are separately capitalized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities.We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt obligations, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock and maintain sufficient cash levels to support our other operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. D.R. Horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in August 2018, registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined. Forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in September 2018, registering $500 million of equity securities. At March\\u00a031, 2021, $370.6 million remained available under Forestar\\u2019s shelf registration statement, of which $76.3 million is reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering program. As market conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. We believe that our existing cash resources, revolving credit facilities, mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our near-term working capital needs and debt obligations.Capital Resources - HomebuildingCash and Cash Equivalents \\u2014 At March\\u00a031, 2021, cash and cash equivalents of our homebuilding segment totaled $1.9 billion.Bank Credit Facilities\\u00a0\\u2014 We have a $1.59 billion senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $2.5 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to 100% of the revolving credit commitment. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the Prime Rate or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin, as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility. The maturity date of the facility is October\\u00a02, 2024. At March\\u00a031, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding and $143.6 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $1.45 billion.In April 2021, our senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility was amended to extend its maturity date to April\\u00a020, 2026. The maturity date may be extended subject to the approval of lenders holding a majority of the commitments. The capacity of the homebuilding revolving credit facility was increased to $2.19 billion with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $3.0 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments.52Table of ContentsIn May 2020, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $375 million 364-day senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $550 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The interest rate on borrowings under the 364-day revolving credit facility may be based on either the Prime Rate or LIBOR plus an applicable margin, as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at March\\u00a031, 2021. This facility is not expected to be renewed upon its maturity on May\\u00a027, 2021.Our homebuilding revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on our operations and activities, including requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level. Both facilities include substantially the same affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreements governing the facilities and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facilities or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. The credit agreements governing the facilities impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At March\\u00a031, 2021, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of our homebuilding revolving credit facilities.Public Unsecured Debt \\u2014 We have $2.55 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes outstanding as of March\\u00a031, 2021 that mature from September 2022 through October 2027. In October 2020, we issued $500 million principal amount of 1.4% senior notes due October\\u00a015, 2027, with interest payable semi-annually. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of the discount and financing costs is 1.6%. In December 2020, we repaid $400 million principal amount of our 2.55% senior notes at maturity. The indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At March\\u00a031, 2021, we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions associated with our public debt obligations.Repurchases of Common Stock \\u2014 We repurchased 5.5 million shares of our common stock for $420.2 million during the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021.Debt and Equity Repurchase Authorizations \\u2014 Effective July\\u00a030, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities and $1.0 billion of our common stock. At March\\u00a031, 2021, the full amount of the debt repurchase authorization was remaining, and $115.1 million of the equity repurchase authorization was remaining. These authorizations have no expiration date. Effective April\\u00a020, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock, replacing the prior authorization. The authorization has no expiration date.Capital Resources - ForestarThe achievement of Forestar\\u2019s long-term growth objectives will depend on its ability to obtain financing in sufficient capacities. As market conditions permit, Forestar may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to provide capital for future growth and additional liquidity.Cash and Cash Equivalents \\u2014 At March\\u00a031, 2021, Forestar had cash and cash equivalents of $167.2 million. Bank Credit Facility\\u00a0\\u2014 Forestar has a $380 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $570 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $100 million and 50% of the revolving credit commitment. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base calculation based on Forestar\\u2019s book value of its real estate assets and unrestricted cash. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. The maturity date of the facility is October\\u00a02, 2022. At March\\u00a031, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding and $46.0 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $334.0 million.In April 2021, Forestar\\u2019s revolving credit facility was amended to extend its maturity date to April\\u00a016, 2025. The maturity date may be extended subject to the approval of lenders holding a majority of the commitments. The capacity of Forestar\\u2019s revolving credit facility was increased to $410 million with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $600 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments.53Table of ContentsThe Forestar revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. The financial covenants require Forestar to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity and a maximum allowable leverage ratio. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. At March\\u00a031, 2021, Forestar was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its revolving credit facility.Unsecured Debt \\u2014 As of March\\u00a031, 2021, Forestar had $350 million principal amount of 8.0% senior notes due 2024 and $300 million principal amount of 5.0% senior notes due 2028. The notes were issued pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and represent unsecured obligations of Forestar.In April 2021, Forestar issued $400 million principal amount of 3.85% senior notes that mature May\\u00a015, 2026 with interest payable semiannually. The annual effective interest rate of the notes after giving effect to the amortization of financing costs is 4.1%. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes will be used to redeem the $350 million principal amount of 8.0% senior notes due April\\u00a015, 2024 in full, and the remainder of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.In April 2021, Forestar delivered notice for the full redemption of its $350 million principal amount of 8.0% senior notes outstanding. The redemption price of $365.6 million includes a call premium of $14.0 million and accrued and unpaid interest of $1.6 million. The notes are scheduled to be redeemed May\\u00a07, 2021.Forestar\\u2019s revolving credit facility and its senior notes are not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. At March\\u00a031, 2021, Forestar was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its revolving credit facility and senior note obligations.Debt Repurchase Authorization \\u2014 Effective April\\u00a030, 2020, Forestar\\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30 million of Forestar\\u2019s debt securities. The authorization has no expiration date. All of the $30 million authorization was remaining at March\\u00a031, 2021.Issuance of Common Stock \\u2014 During the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, Forestar issued 1.0\\u00a0million shares of common stock under its at-the-market equity offering program for proceeds of $23.3 million, net of commissions and other issuance costs. At March\\u00a031, 2021, $370.6 million remained available for issuance under Forestar\\u2019s shelf registration statement, of which $76.3 million is reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering program.Capital Resources - Financial ServicesCash and Cash Equivalents\\u00a0\\u2014 At March\\u00a031, 2021, cash and cash equivalents of our financial services operations totaled $94.7 million.Mortgage Repurchase Facility \\u2014 Our mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, has a mortgage repurchase facility that provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties upon receipt of funds from the counterparties. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 60 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. In February 2021, the mortgage repurchase facility was amended to increase its capacity and extend its maturity date to February\\u00a018, 2022. The total capacity of the facility is $1.4 billion; however, the capacity increases, without requiring additional commitments, to $1.633 billion for approximately 30 days at each quarter end and 45 days at fiscal year end. The capacity of the facility can also be increased to $1.8 billion, subject to the availability of additional commitments.As of March\\u00a031, 2021, $1.69 billion of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $1.66 billion were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility. As a result of advance paydowns totaling $454.8 million, DHI Mortgage had an obligation of $1.2 billion outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at March\\u00a031, 2021 at a 2.1% annual interest rate.54Table of ContentsThe mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. The facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary\\u2019s minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable leverage ratio and its minimum required liquidity. These covenants are measured and reported to the lenders monthly. At March\\u00a031, 2021, DHI Mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.In the past, DHI Mortgage has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.Operating Cash Flow ActivitiesIn the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $154.9 million compared to $395.1 million in the prior year period. Cash used in operating activities in the current year period primarily consisted of $249.5 million and $32.3 million of cash used in our Forestar and financial services segments, respectively, partially offset by $138.0 million of cash provided by our homebuilding segment.Cash used to increase construction in progress and finished home inventory was $1.3 billion in the current year period compared to $724.4 million in the prior year period. In both periods, the expenditures were made to support increased sales and closing volumes. Cash used to increase residential land and lots in the current year period was $975.2 million compared to $324.2 million in the prior year period. Of these amounts, $377.2 million and $171.4 million, respectively, related to Forestar.\\u00a0The most significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both periods was net income. Also, pursuant to IRS News Release 2021-43, we have deferred approximately $215 million of federal and certain state estimated tax payments originally due March\\u00a015, 2021 until June\\u00a015, 2021 as a result of the Texas winter storm. This deferral provided $215 million of cash from operations during the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021. Investing Cash Flow ActivitiesIn the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $196.1 million compared to $34.6 million in the prior year period. In the current year period, uses of cash included expenditures related to our rental operations totaling $173.9 million, an acquisition of the homebuilding operations of Braselton Homes for $23.0 million and purchases of property and equipment totaling $30.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a single-family rental community for $31.8 million. In the prior year period, uses of cash included expenditures related to our rental operations totaling $113.0 million and purchases of property and equipment totaling $47.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets primarily consisting of $128.5 million related to the sale of two multi-family rental properties.Financing Cash Flow ActivitiesWe expect the short-term financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Long-term financing needs for our homebuilding and Forestar operations may be funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities or equity securities through the capital markets.During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, net cash used in financing activities was $457.2 million, consisting primarily of repayment of $400 million principal amount of our 2.55% homebuilding senior notes at maturity, payment of cash dividends totaling $145.6 million and cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of $420.2 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by note proceeds from our issuance of $500 million principal amount of 1.4% homebuilding senior notes and net advances of $70.9 million on our mortgage repurchase facility.55Table of ContentsDuring the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $453.0 million, consisting primarily of note proceeds of $800 million from draws on our homebuilding revolving credit facility, our issuance of $500 million principal amount of 2.5% homebuilding senior notes, Forestar\\u2019s issuance of $300 million principal amount of 5.0% senior notes and net advances of $297.6 million on our mortgage repurchase facility. Note proceeds were partially offset by repayment of amounts drawn on our homebuilding revolving credit facility totaling $300 million, repayment of $500 million principal amount of our 4.0% senior notes at maturity, Forestar\\u2019s repayment of $118.9 million principal amount of its 3.75% convertible senior notes at maturity, cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of $360.4 million and payment of cash dividends totaling $128.7 million.During each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2021, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share, the most recent of which was paid on February\\u00a025, 2021 to stockholders of record on February\\u00a017, 2021. In April 2021, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share, payable on May\\u00a020, 2021 to stockholders of record on May\\u00a010, 2021. Cash dividends of $0.175 per common share were approved and paid in each quarter of fiscal 2020. The declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, financial condition and general business conditions.56Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS, COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSOur primary contractual cash obligations are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases. We expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources, cash flows generated from profits, our credit facilities or other bank financing, and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit.At March\\u00a031, 2021, we had outstanding letters of credit of $189.6 million and surety bonds of $2.1 billion, issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have no material third-party guarantees.Our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in Item\\u00a03 \\u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\u201d under Part\\u00a0I of this quarterly report on Form\\u00a010-Q.We enter into land and lot purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot purchase contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment. Among our homebuilding land and lot purchase contracts at March\\u00a031, 2021, there were a limited number of contracts with $80.5 million of remaining purchase price subject to specific performance provisions that may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their respective contractual obligations. Of this amount, $41.5 million related to contracts between our homebuilding segment and Forestar. Further information about our land purchase contracts is provided in the \\u201cHomebuilding Inventories, Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory\\u201d section included herein.57Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATIONAs of March\\u00a031, 2021, D.R. Horton, Inc. had outstanding $2.55 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes due through October 2027 and no amounts outstanding on its homebuilding revolving credit facilities.All of the homebuilding senior notes and the homebuilding revolving credit facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain subsidiaries of D.R. Horton, Inc. (Guarantors or Guarantor Subsidiaries). Each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by D.R. Horton, Inc. Our subsidiaries associated with the Forestar lot development operation, financial services operations, multi-family residential construction and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the homebuilding senior notes or the homebuilding revolving credit facilities (collectively, Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries). The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor and rank equal with all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor and senior to all subordinated debt of such Guarantor. The guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The guarantees will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Guarantors.The guarantees by a Guarantor Subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) the sale or other disposition of its common stock whereby it is no longer a subsidiary of ours; (2) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets (other than to us or another Guarantor); (3) its merger or consolidation with an entity other than us or another Guarantor; or (4) its ceasing to guarantee any of our publicly traded debt securities and ceasing to guarantee any of our obligations under our homebuilding revolving credit facility.The following tables present summarized financial information for D.R. Horton, Inc. and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated among D.R. Horton, Inc. and the Guarantor Subsidiaries, as well as their investment in, and equity in earnings from the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.D.R.

Generally, however, a company would be considered insolvent for purposes of the foregoing if the sum of the company\\u2019s debts, including contingent, unliquidated and unmatured liabilities, is greater than all of such company\\u2019s property at a fair valuation, or if the present fair saleable value of the company\\u2019s assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured.The indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes contain a \\u201csavings clause,\\u201d which limits the liability of each Guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such Guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, it may reduce such Guarantor\\u2019s obligation such that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would not suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due. On the basis of historical financial information, operating history and other factors, we believe that each of the Guarantors, after giving effect to the issuance of the guarantees when such guarantees were issued, was not insolvent, did not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it engaged and did not and has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. We cannot assure you, however, as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESAs disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September\\u00a030, 2020, our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventories and cost of sales, warranty claims and legal claims and insurance. Since September\\u00a030, 2020, there have been no significant changes to those critical accounting policies.As disclosed in our critical accounting policies in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September\\u00a030, 2020, our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims. At March\\u00a031, 2021 and September\\u00a030, 2020, we had reserves for approximately 320 and 260 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, we established reserves for approximately 115 new construction defect claims and resolved 55 construction defect claims for a total cost of $6.2 million. At March\\u00a031, 2020 and September\\u00a030, 2019, we had reserves for approximately 220 and 180 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, we established reserves for approximately 85 new construction defect claims and resolved 45 construction defect claims for a total cost of $18.3 million.SEASONALITYAlthough significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in our homebuilding, lot development and financial services operations. As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.59Table of ContentsForward-Looking StatementsSome of the statements contained in this report, as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the SEC, statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts, stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us, may be construed as \\u201cforward-looking statements\\u201d within the meaning of Section\\u00a027A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section\\u00a021E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Accordingly, you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the information included in our 2019 Annual Report as well as the unaudited financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.\\nIn addition, the statements and assumptions in this Quarterly Report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 or Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, including, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies and prospects as well as estimates of industry growth for the next quarter and beyond. For important information regarding these forward-looking statements, please see the discussion below under the caption \\u201cCautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements.\\u201d\\nOverview\\nCBRE Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation. References to \\u201cCBRE,\\u201d \\u201cthe company,\\u201d \\u201cwe,\\u201d \\u201cus\\u201d and \\u201cour\\u201d refer to CBRE Group, Inc. and include all of its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise.\\nWe are the world\\u2019s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2019 revenue, with leading global market positions in leasing, property sales, occupier outsourcing and valuations. As of December\\u00a031, 2019, we operated in more than 530 offices worldwide and had more than 100,000 employees, excluding independent affiliates. We serve clients in more than 100 countries.\\nOur business is focused on providing services to real estate occupiers and investors. For occupiers, we provide facilities management, project management, transaction (both property sales and leasing) and consulting services, among others. For investors, we provide capital markets (property sales, mortgage origination, sales and servicing), leasing, investment management, property management, valuation and development services, among others. We provide services under the following brand names: \\u201cCBRE\\u201d (real estate advisory and outsourcing services); \\u201cCBRE Global Investors\\u201d (investment management); \\u201cTrammell Crow Company\\u201d (U.S. development); \\u201cTelford Homes\\u201d (U.K. development) and \\u201cHana\\u201d (enterprise-focused flexible workspace solutions).\\nOur revenue mix has shifted in recent years toward more contractual revenue earned by providing multiple services to occupiers and investors, who increasingly prefer to purchase integrated, account-based services from firms that meet the full spectrum of their needs nationally and globally. We believe we are well-positioned to capture a substantial share of this growing market opportunity. We generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and commissions on transactions. Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses generally involve occupier outsourcing (including facilities and project management), property management, investment management, appraisal/valuation and loan servicing.\\nIn 2019, we generated revenue from a highly diversified base of clients, including more than 90 of the Fortune 100 companies. We have been an S&P 500 company since 2006 and in 2020 we were ranked #128 on the Fortune\\u00a0500. We have been voted the most recognized commercial real estate brand in the Lipsey Company survey for 19 years in a row (including 2020). We have also been rated a World\\u2019s Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute for seven consecutive years (including 2020) and are included in the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index and the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. \\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID\\u201119) global pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 has created a tremendous amount of uncertainty, precipitated a global economic contraction and severely disrupted both business activity and global real estate markets. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, many of our locations and those of our clients remain subject to significant operational limitations intended to stem the spread of COVID\\u201119 and a substantial portion of our employee population continues to work remotely, even in jurisdictions where government stay-at-home orders have been eased. \\n25\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCritical Accounting Policies\\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. A discussion of such critical accounting policies, which include revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes can be found in our 2019 Annual Report. There have been no material changes to these policies as of September 30, 2020.\\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\\nSeasonality\\nHistorically, a significant portion of our revenue has been seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. In a typical year, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities have tended to be lowest in the first quarter, and highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Revenue, earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to year-end. In light of the severe economic dislocations caused by COVID\\u201119, and the resulting uncertainty in the business outlook, the quarterly distribution of financial results in 2020 may not conform with historical patterns.\\nInflation\\nOur commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by inflation. However, to date, we believe that general inflation has not had a material impact upon our operations.\\nItems Affecting Comparability\\nWhen you read our financial statements and the information included in this Quarterly Report, you should consider that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results. We believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future.\\nMacroeconomic Conditions\\nEconomic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly. These include overall economic activity and employment growth, with specific sensitivity to growth in office-based employment; interest rate levels and changes in interest rates; the cost and availability of credit; and the impact of tax and regulatory policies. Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, will negatively affect the performance of our business.\\n26\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCompensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production. As a result, negative effects on our operating margins of difficult market conditions, such as we are currently experiencing with the pandemic, is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. In addition, when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance, and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved. Additionally, our contractual revenue generally has typically increased primarily as a result of growth in our outsourcing business, and we believe this contractual revenue should help offset the negative impacts that macroeconomic deterioration could have on other parts of our business. Nevertheless, adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our consolidated operations and financial condition.\\nFrom 2010 to early 2020, commercial real estate markets had generally been characterized by increased demand for space, falling vacancies, higher rents and strong capital flows, leading to solid property sales and leasing activity. This healthy backdrop changed abruptly in the first quarter of 2020 with the emergence of the COVID\\u201119 pandemic and resultant sharp contraction of economic activity across much of the world. There has been a significant impact on commercial real estate markets, as many property owners and occupiers have put transactions on hold and withdrawn existing mandates, sharply reducing sales and leasing volumes. We expect to see this trend continue, as concerns about a COVID-19 resurgence are high across our major markets. The recovery of real estate markets around the world remained uncertain as of October 2020.\\n\\u00a0\\nCOVID-19 is putting downward pressure on parts of our business and creating larger opportunities in other parts. The severe economic effects of the pandemic continued to weigh heavily on higher-margin property lease and sales revenue in the Advisory Services segment. However, global industrial leasing revenue, fueled by e-commerce, and project management activities for occupier clients were resilient during the third quarter.\\u00a0Also, during the third quarter, our Continental Europe business showed signs of recovery and benefited from our diverse service offering during the period.\\nThe performance of our global real estate services and investment businesses depends on an improvement in macroeconomic conditions, including restored business and consumer confidence, sustained economic growth, solid job creation and, stable, functioning global credit markets.\\nEffects of Acquisitions\\nWe historically have made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add and enhance service competencies around the world. On October 1, 2019, we acquired Telford Homes Plc (Telford) to expand our real estate development business outside the United States (Telford Acquisition). A leading developer of multifamily residential properties in the London area, Telford is reported in our Real Estate Investments segment. Telford was acquired for \\u00a3267.1 million, or $328.5 million along with the assumption of $110.7 million (\\u00a390.0 million) of debt and the acquisition of cash from Telford of $7.9 million (\\u00a36.4 million). The Telford Acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\\nStrategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in strengthening our service offerings. The companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform, or independent affiliates in which, in some cases, we held a small equity interest. During 2019, we completed eight in-fill acquisitions: a leading advanced analytics software company based in the United Kingdom, a commercial and residential real estate appraisal firm headquartered in Florida, our former affiliate in Omaha, a project management firm in Australia, a valuation and consulting business in Switzerland, a leading project management firm in Israel, a full-service real estate firm in San Antonio with a focus on retail, office, medical office and land, and a debt-focused real estate investment management business in the United Kingdom. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we acquired leading local facilities management firms in Spain and Italy, a U.S. firm that helps companies reduce telecommunications costs, a leading provider of workplace technology project management, consulting and procurement services to occupiers across the U.S. and a firm specializing in performing real estate valuations in South Korea.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n27\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nWe believe strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position \\u2013 or expand our capabilities \\u2013 within targeted markets or business lines. In general, however, most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating income and net income as a result of transaction-related expenditures, including severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, as well as costs and charges associated with integrating the acquired business and integrating its financial and accounting systems into our own.\\nOur acquisition agreements often require us to pay deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments, subject to the acquired company achieving certain performance metrics, and/or the passage of time as well as other conditions. As of September 30, 2020, we have accrued deferred consideration totaling $89.7 million, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\\nInternational Operations\\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID\\u201119 global pandemic on business conditions across all regions worldwide. COVID\\u201119 has significantly impacted our operations and has the potential to further reduce our business activity. In addition, we continue to monitor developments related to the United Kingdom\\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) and the uncertainty of the long-term economic and trade relationship between the United Kingdom and European Union. The continued uncertainty has the potential to impact our businesses in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, particularly sales and leasing activity in the United Kingdom. Any currency volatility associated with COVID\\u201119, Brexit or other economic dislocations could also impact our results of operations. \\nAs we continue to increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our Real Estate Investments business has a significant amount of euro-denominated assets under management, or AUM, as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe. In addition, our Global Workplace Solutions business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies, such as the euro and the British pound sterling. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our AUM, revenue and earnings.\\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2020, approximately 43.1% of our business was transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies, the majority of which included the Australian dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar and Swiss franc.

39 currencies comprise 7.1% and 6.8% of our revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, and approximately 38 currencies comprise 6.8% and 6.9% of our revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively.\\n\\u00a0\\n28\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nAlthough we operate globally, we report our results in U.S. dollars. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results. For example, we estimate that had the British pound sterling-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the net impact would have been a decrease in pre-tax income of $1.1 million. Had the euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $6.0 million. These hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into U.S. dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10% change in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations.\\nDue to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. Our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which affect the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. We routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.\\n29\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nResults of Operations\\nThe following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended

revenue and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measurements under GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We generally use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. We believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\\n30\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nFee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients. We believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the company\\u2019s overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients, and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business.\\nEBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and asset impairments. Amounts shown for adjusted EBITDA further remove (from EBITDA) the impact of costs associated with transformation initiatives, certain carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue, fair value adjustments to real estate assets acquired in the Telford Acquisition (purchase accounting) that were sold in the period, costs incurred related to legal entity restructuring, integration and other costs related to acquisitions, costs associated with workforce optimization efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and costs associated with our reorganization, including cost-savings initiatives. We believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending.\\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our discretionary use because it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. This measure may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt. We also use adjusted EBITDA as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.\\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows (dollars

during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, management began the implementation of certain transformation initiatives to enable the company to reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. The majority of expenses incurred were cash in nature and primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees. See Note 15 for further discussion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nPrimarily represents costs incurred related to workforce optimization initiated and executed in the second quarter of 2020 as part of management\\u2019s cost containment efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The charges are cash expenditures primarily for severance costs incurred related to this effort. Of the total costs, $7.4 million was included within the \\u201cCost of revenue\\u201d line item and $30.2 million was included in the \\u201cOperating, administrative, and other\\u201d line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.  \\n31\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nPrimarily represents severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with our reorganization announced in the third quarter of 2018 that became effective January 1, 2019.\\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 \\nWe reported consolidated net income of $184.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 on revenue of $5.6 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $256.6 million on revenue of $5.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2019.\\nOur revenue on a consolidated basis for the three months ended September 30, 2020 decreased by $280.0 million, or 4.7%, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019. The revenue decrease reflects the impact of COVID-19 on our Advisory Services segment, which resulted in lower sales (down 34.1%) and leasing revenue (down 31.4%) as well as decreased commercial mortgage origination activity (down 21.2%). These declines were partially offset by higher revenue in our Global Workplace Solutions segment (up 4.7%) led by growth in our facilities management line of business, driven by its contractual nature, and improved revenue in our Real Estate Investments segment (up 31.3%) largely due to the Telford Acquisition. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% positive impact on total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by strength in the Australian dollar, British pound sterling and euro, partially offset by weakness in the Argentine peso, Brazilian real and Indian rupee.\\nOur cost of revenue on a consolidated basis decreased by $122.8 million, or 2.6%, during the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by lower commission expense. Our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our sales and lease revenue performance. Accordingly, the decrease in advisory sales and leasing revenue as a result of COVID-19 led to a corresponding decrease in commission expense. Lower bonuses in our Advisory Services segment attributable to lower revenue as a result of COVID-19 also contributed to the variance. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% negative impact on total cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020. These items were largely offset by higher costs associated with our Global Workplace Solutions segment. We also incurred $15.7 million of costs (primarily employee separation benefits) related to certain transformation initiatives implemented by the company in the third quarter of 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased to 80.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from 79.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by our mix of revenue, with revenue from our Global Workplace Solutions segment, which has a lower margin than our other revenue streams, comprising a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior year period.\\nOur operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis decreased by $15.4 million, or 1.9%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The negative impact of COVID-19 on our operating results led to a corresponding decrease in compensation expense for equity awards. In addition, we reduced general business operating expenses such as travel and entertainment, marketing and employee events to improve financial performance for the three months ended September 30, 2020. These items were partially offset by an increase in certain costs as a result of COVID-19, including higher bad debt expense. We also incurred $39.7 million of costs, primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees, as management commenced the implementation of certain transformation initiatives during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 to enable the company to prospectively reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. Additionally, investments were made in both people and technology associated with efforts to remediate material weaknesses in our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region of our Global Workplace Solutions segment. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.9% negative impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2020. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 14.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from 13.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, primarily attributable to our Advisory Services segment. \\nOur depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $16.2 million, or 14.5%, during the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to a rise in depreciation expense of $15.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2020 driven by technology-related capital expenditures.\\n32\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nOur gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was $52.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which was a substantial increase over the prior year period. These gains resulted from property sales within our Real Estate Investments segment.\\nOur equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $6.6 million, or 25.5%, during the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by higher equity earnings in our investment management line of business within our Real Estate Investments segment, partially offset by lower equity earnings in our Advisory Services segment.\\nOur consolidated interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $4.0 million, or 18.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. This was primarily due to lower interest expense on borrowings associated with our credit agreement (driven by lower interest rates) as well as reduced net interest expense overseas associated with cash pooling arrangements. \\nOur provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $49.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to $63.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease of $14.4 million was primarily related to the corresponding decrease in our consolidated pre-tax book income. Our effective tax rate increased to 21.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from 19.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to a larger impact on a percentage basis of unfavorable permanent book tax differences in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions due to lower pre-tax book income. \\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 \\nWe reported consolidated net income of $438.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on revenue of $16.9 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $644.7 million on revenue of $16.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.\\nOur revenue on a consolidated basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased by $141.0 million, or 0.8%, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The revenue increase reflects higher revenue in our Global Workplace Solutions segment (up 10.2%) led by growth in our facilities management line of business, driven by its contractual nature, and improved revenue in our Real Estate Investments segment (up 31.1%) largely due to the Telford Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue in our Advisory Services segment due to the impact of COVID-19, including lower sales (down 26.1%) and leasing revenue (down 25.6%) as well as decreased commercial mortgage origination activity (down 17.0%). Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by weakness in the Australian dollar, Argentine peso, Brazilian real and Indian rupee, partially offset by strength in the British pound sterling.\\nOur cost of revenue on a consolidated basis increased by $521.6 million, or 4.0%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our Global Workplace Solutions segment and higher costs in our Real Estate Investments segment due to the Telford Acquisition. We also incurred $15.7 million of costs (primarily employee separation benefits) related to certain transformation initiatives implemented by the company in the third quarter of 2020. These items were partially offset by lower commission expense incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. As previously mentioned, our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our sales and lease revenue performance. Accordingly, the decrease in advisory sales and leasing revenue led to a corresponding decrease in commission expense. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% positive impact on total cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased to 80.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from 78.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily driven by our mix of revenue, with revenue from our Global Workplace Solutions segment, which has a lower margin than our other revenue streams, comprising a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior year period. \\n33\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nOur operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis decreased by $124.8 million, or 5.0%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The negative impact of COVID-19 on our operating results led to corresponding decreases in bonus, compensation expense for equity awards and carried interest expense. In addition, we reduced certain operating expenses such as travel and entertainment, marketing and employee events to improve financial performance. During the first half of 2019, we incurred $47.0 million of costs in connection with our reorganization, which did not recur in the current period. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.6% positive impact on total operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. These items were partially offset by $39.7 million of costs, primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees, as management commenced the implementation of certain transformation initiatives during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 to enable the company to prospectively reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we also incurred higher incremental costs associated with Telford, which we acquired on October 1, 2019 (nine months of operating expenses incurred in 2020 versus $13.3 million of transaction costs incurred pre-acquisition during the nine months ended September 30, 2019), rent expense for our new flexible space offering and higher bad debt expense as a result of COVID-19. We also incurred $30.2 million of costs (mainly severance) primarily related to workforce optimization initiated and executed in the second quarter of 2020 as part of management\\u2019s cost containment efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, in the first half of 2020, we saw an increase in charitable donations largely driven by a sizeable donation by the Company to its COVID-19 Relief Fund. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 13.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from 14.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, reflecting the operating leverage inherent in our business. \\nOur depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $34.0 million, or 10.5%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to a rise in depreciation expense of $34.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 driven by technology-related capital expenditures.\\nOur asset impairments on a consolidated basis totaled $75.2 million and $89.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded $50.2 million of non-cash asset impairment charges in our Global Workplace Solutions segment and a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $25.0 million in our Real Estate Investments segment. As a result of the recent global economic disruption and uncertainty due to COVID\\u201119, we deemed there to be triggering events in the first quarter of 2020 that required testing of certain assets for impairment at that time. Based on these tests, we recorded the aforementioned non-cash impairment charges, which were driven by lower anticipated cash flows in certain businesses directly resulting from a downturn in forecasts as well as increased forecast risk due to COVID\\u201119. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we recorded a non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of $89.0 million in our Real Estate Investments segment. This non-cash write-off resulted from a review of the anticipated cash flows and the decrease in assets under management in our public securities business driven in part by continued industry-wide shift in investor preference for passive investment programs.\\nOur gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis increased by $55.9 million, or 290.0%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. These gains resulted from property sales within our Real Estate Investments segment.\\nOur equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis decreased by $47.7 million, or 39.7%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by lower equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our Real Estate Investments segment.\\nOur consolidated interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $15.8 million, or 23.4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. This was primarily due to lower interest expense on borrowings associated with our credit agreement (driven by lower interest rates) as well as reduced net interest expense overseas associated with cash pooling arrangements. \\nOur write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was $2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. These costs were incurred in connection with the refinancing of our credit agreement.\\n34\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nOur provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $119.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to $169.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease of approximately $50.9 million was primarily related to the corresponding decrease in consolidated pre-tax book income. Our effective tax rate increased to 21.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from 20.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to a larger impact on a percentage basis of unfavorable permanent book tax differences in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions due to lower pre-tax book income. On March\\u00a027, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in the United States in response to the COVID\\u201119 pandemic. The CARES Act has not had, nor is it expected to have, a significant impact on our effective tax rate for 2020.\\nSegment Operations \\nWe organize our operations around, and publicly report our financial results on, three global business segments: (1) Advisory Services; (2) Global Workplace Solutions; and (3) Real Estate Investments.

during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, management began the implementation of certain transformation initiatives to enable the company to reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. The majority of expenses incurred were cash in nature and primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees. See Note 15 for further discussion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nPrimarily represents costs incurred related to workforce optimization initiated and executed in the second quarter of 2020 as part of management\\u2019s cost containment efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The charges are cash expenditures primarily for severance costs incurred related to this effort. Of the total costs, $6.1 million was included within the \\u201cCost of revenue\\u201d line item and $21.3 million was included in the \\u201cOperating, administrative, and other\\u201d line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nPrimarily represents severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with our reorganization announced in the third quarter of 2018 that became effective January 1, 2019.\\n36\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2019\\nRevenue decreased by $486.5 million, or 21.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019. The revenue decrease primarily reflects the impact of COVID-19, which resulted in lower sales and leasing revenue as well as decreased commercial mortgage origination activity. Foreign currency translation had a 0.4% positive impact on total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by strength in the British pound sterling and euro, partially offset by weakness in the Brazilian real.\\nCost of revenue decreased by $284.0 million, or 20.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to reduced commission expense resulting from lower sales and leasing revenue as a result of COVID-19. Lower bonuses attributable to lower revenue as a result of COVID-19 also contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by $11.8 million of costs (primarily employee separation benefits) related to certain transformation initiatives implemented by the company in the third quarter of 2020. In addition, foreign currency translation had a 0.5% negative impact on total cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was relatively consistent at 61.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 versus 61.1% for the same period in 2019.\\nOperating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $50.7 million, or 9.6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019. The negative impact of COVID-19 on our operating results led to corresponding decreases in bonus and compensation expense for equity awards. In addition, to improve financial performance, we reduced certain operating expenses such as travel and entertainment, marketing, employee events and costs for 3rd party consultants. A reduction to general business operating expenses such as timing for our E&O insurance premium expense for the three months ended September 30, 2020, also contributed to the decline. These items were partially offset by an increase in certain costs as a result of COVID-19, including higher bad debt expense. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.5% negative impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2020. We also incurred $26.5 million of costs, primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees, as management commenced the implementation of certain transformation initiatives during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 to enable the company to prospectively reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth.\\nIn connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans for which the company retains servicing rights, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the retained mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) on the date the loans are sold. Upon origination of a mortgage loan held for sale, the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights to be retained is included in the forecasted proceeds from the anticipated loan sale and results in a net gain (which is reflected in revenue). Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized (within amortization expense) and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. They are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that the servicing income is expected to be received. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, MSRs contributed to operating income $54.5 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $34.0 million of amortization of related intangible assets. For the three months ended September 30, 2019, MSRs contributed to operating income $59.6 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $32.8 million of amortization of related intangible assets.\\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019\\nRevenue decreased by $1.0 billion, or 16.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The revenue decrease primarily reflects the impact of COVID-19, which resulted in lower sales and leasing revenue as well as decreased commercial mortgage origination activity. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by weakness in the Australian dollar, Brazilian real and Indian rupee.\\n37\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCost of revenue decreased by $551.8 million, or 14.7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to reduced commission expense resulting from lower sales and leasing revenue as a result of COVID-19. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.6% positive impact on total cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. These decreases were partially offset by $11.8 million of costs (primarily employee separation benefits) related to certain transformation initiatives implemented by the company in the third quarter of 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 61.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 from 60.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.\\nOperating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $121.3 million, or 7.7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The negative impact of COVID-19 on our operating results led to corresponding decreases in bonus and compensation expense for equity awards. In addition, to improve financial performance, we reduced certain operating expenses such as travel and entertainment, marketing and employee events. During the first half of 2019, we incurred $10.5 million of costs in connection with our reorganization, which did not recur in the current period. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.7% positive impact on total operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. These items were partially offset by $26.5 million of costs, primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees, as management commenced the implementation of certain transformation initiatives during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 to enable the company to prospectively reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. We also incurred certain costs as a result of COVID-19, including higher bad debt expense. We also incurred $21.3 million of costs (mainly severance) primarily related to workforce optimization initiated and executed in the second quarter of 2020 as part of management\\u2019s cost containment efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, in the first half of 2020, we saw an increase in charitable donations largely driven by a sizeable donation by the Company to its COVID-19 Relief Fund.\\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2020, MSRs contributed to operating income $127.8 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $96.4 million of amortization of related intangible assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, MSRs contributed to operating income $142.1 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $89.8 million of amortization of related intangible assets.\\n38\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nGlobal Workplace Solutions\\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for our Global Workplace Solutions

during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, management began the implementation of certain transformation initiatives to enable the company to reduce costs, streamline operations and support future

The charges are cash expenditures primarily for severance costs incurred related to this effort. Of the total costs, $1.2 million was included within the \\u201cCost of revenue\\u201d line item and $3.8 million was included in the \\u201cOperating, administrative, and other\\u201d line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nPrimarily represents severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with our reorganization announced in the third quarter of 2018 that became effective January 1, 2019.\\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2019\\nRevenue increased by $166.2 million, or 4.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in our facilities management line of business, which is contractual in nature. Foreign currency translation had a 0.7% positive impact on total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by strength in the British pound sterling and euro, partially offset by weakness in the Argentine peso, Brazilian real and Indian rupee.\\n39\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCost of revenue increased by $120.8 million, or 3.6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, driven by the higher revenue. We also incurred $3.9 million of costs (primarily employee separation benefits) related to certain transformation initiatives implemented by the company in the third quarter of 2020. In addition, foreign currency translation had a 0.7% negative impact on total cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to 92.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from 93.3% for the same period in 2019.\\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased by $19.9 million, or 14.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was largely attributable to $13.2 million of costs, primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees, as management commenced the implementation of certain transformation initiatives during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 to enable the company to prospectively reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. In addition, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, investments were made in both people and technology associated with efforts to remediate material weaknesses in our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. Foreign currency translation also had a 1.4% negative impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2020. These increases were partially offset by a reduction to certain operating expenses, such as travel and entertainment costs, in the third quarter of 2020 as a result of COVID-19. \\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019\\nRevenue increased by $1.0 billion, or 10.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in our facilities management line of business, which is contractual in nature. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by weakness in the Argentine peso, Brazilian real and Indian rupee, partially offset by strength in the British pound sterling.\\nCost of revenue increased by $947.9 million, or 10.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, driven by the higher revenue. We also incurred $3.9 million of costs (primarily employee separation benefits) related to certain transformation initiatives implemented by the company in the third quarter of 2020. Foreign currency translation had a 0.6% positive impact on total cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was consistent at 92.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019.\\nOperating, administrative and other expenses increased by $9.5 million, or 2.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was largely attributable to $13.2 million of costs, primarily related to employee separation benefits, lease termination costs and professional fees, as management commenced the implementation of certain transformation initiatives during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 to enable the company to prospectively reduce costs, streamline operations and support future growth. Certain costs were also incurred as a result of COVID-19, including higher bad debt expense, and $3.8 million of costs incurred (mainly severance) primarily related to workforce optimization initiated and executed in the second quarter of 2020 as part of management\\u2019s cost containment efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, investments were also made in both people and technology associated with efforts to remediate material weaknesses in our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. Lastly, in the first half of 2020, we also saw an increase in charitable donations largely driven by a sizeable donation by the Company to its COVID-19 Relief Fund.\\u00a0These increases were partially offset by a reduction to certain operating expenses, such as travel and entertainment costs, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as a result of COVID-19. Additionally, during the first half of 2019, we incurred $36.3 million of costs in connection with our reorganization, which did not recur in the current period.

Foreign currency translation also had a 1.9% negative impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2020.

These increases were partially offset by decreases in acquisition, disposition, incentive and development fees due to the impact of COVID-19. Foreign currency translation had a 0.1% negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily driven by weakness in the euro.\\nCost of revenue was $125.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and was attributable to Telford, thus there is no prior period comparison.\\n42\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nOperating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $13.0 million, or 2.8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. The negative impact of COVID-19 on our operating results led to a corresponding decrease in carried interest expense. We also reduced certain operating expenses, such as travel and entertainment costs, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as a result of COVID-19. During the first half of 2019, we also incurred $5.2 million of costs in connection with our reorganization, which did not recur in the current period. These decreases were partially offset by higher incremental costs associated with Telford, which we acquired on October 1, 2019 (nine months of operating expenses incurred in 2020 versus $13.3 million of transaction costs incurred pre-acquisition during the nine months ended September 30, 2019) and rent expense for our new flexible space offering for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Foreign currency translation had a negligible impact on total operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\\n\\u00a0\\nA roll forward of our AUM by product type for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 is as follows (dollars in billions):\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nFunds\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nSeparate\\u00a0Accounts\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nSecurities\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at January 1, 2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n40.1\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n64.9\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n7.9\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n112.9\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nInflows\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n4.4\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5.8\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n11.3\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nOutflows\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(1.3\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(6.4\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(1.3\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(9.0\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\nMarket appreciation (depreciation)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(1.4\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(0.9\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(0.7\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at September 30, 2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n44.8\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n62.9\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n6.8\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n114.5\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nWe describe above how we calculate AUM. Also, as noted above, our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nWe believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we incurred $161.9 million of capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions received, which includes approximately $71.7 million related to technology enablement. Due to the uncertainty caused by COVID\\u201119, we expect our 2020 net capital expenditures to be meaningfully lower than initially forecast in our 2019 Annual Report. As of September 30, 2020, we had aggregate commitments of $84.0 million to fund future co-investments in our Real Estate Investments business, $10.4 million of which is expected to be funded in 2020. Additionally, as of September 30, 2020, we are committed to fund $41.0 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our Real Estate Investments business, which we may be required to fund at any time. As of September 30, 2020, we had $2.8 billion of borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate use.\\nWe have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and general investment requirements (including strategic in-fill acquisitions) and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements. In the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months. Given compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production, the negative effect of difficult market conditions is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. In addition, when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance, and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved. We may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments, as we have done in the past, with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we deem attractive. We may also, from time to time in our sole discretion, purchase, redeem, or retire our existing senior notes, through tender offers, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, or otherwise.\\n43\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nAs noted above, we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing. In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable. However, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions.\\nOur long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, are generally comprised of three elements. The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness. If our cash flow is insufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates. We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.\\nThe second long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions. Our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions. As of September 30, 2020, we had accrued $89.7 million ($20.6 million of which was a current liability) of deferred purchase consideration, which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\\nLastly, as described in our 2019 Annual Report, our board of directors has authorized a program for the company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2019, $400.0 million was available for share repurchases under the authorized repurchase program. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we spent $50.0 million to repurchase, through an existing stock repurchase plan entered into pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, 1,050,084 shares of our Class A common stock with an average price paid per share of $47.62. We did not repurchase any of our stock during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and the three months ended September 30, 2020. As of October 29, 2020, we had $350.0 million of capacity remaining under our current stock repurchase program. Our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future stock repurchases with existing cash. We may utilize our stock repurchase program to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program and on a more opportunistic basis if we believe our stock presents a compelling investment compared to other discretionary uses. The timing of future repurchases, and the actual amounts repurchased, will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions and other factors.\\nHistorical Cash Flows\\nOperating Activities \\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $860.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of $685.9 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The company experienced an overall increase in net working capital of approximately $886.7 million, partially offset by lower net income of $211.8 million as compared to the same period in the previous year. The positive impact from net working capital was largely attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable due to a heightened focus on cash collections across our businesses, and lower corporate income tax payments, partially offset by a net decrease to accounts payable and accrued expenses, as well as compensation payable and accrued bonus.\\nInvesting Activities\\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $206.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of $65.2 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was largely driven by lower capital expenditures, greater distributions received from unconsolidated subsidiaries as well as lower contributions to unconsolidated subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This was partially offset by higher amounts paid for in-fill acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. \\n44\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nFinancing Activities\\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $111.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of $59.4 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings of $52.0 million from our revolving credit facility and $43.2 million in lower net contributions received from non-controlling interests for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, partially offset by the impact of $44.1 million in less proceeds used for repurchase of common stock during the current period.\\nIndebtedness\\nOur level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to pay the principal amount of our indebtedness and other obligations when due. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.\\nLong-Term Debt\\nWe maintain credit facilities with third-party lenders, which we use for a variety of purposes. On March 4, 2019, CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE Services) entered into an incremental assumption agreement with respect to its credit agreement, dated October 31, 2017 (such credit agreement, as amended by a December 20, 2018 incremental loan assumption agreement and such March 4, 2019 incremental assumption agreement, the 2019 Credit Agreement), which (i) extended the maturity of the U.S. dollar tranche A term loans under such credit agreement, (ii) extended the termination date of the revolving credit commitments available under such credit agreement and (iii) made certain changes to the interest rates and fees applicable to such tranche A term loans and revolving credit commitments under such credit agreement. The proceeds from the new tranche A term loan facility under the 2019 Credit Agreement were used to repay the $300.0 million of tranche A term loans outstanding under the credit agreement in effect prior to the entry into this 2019 incremental assumption agreement.\\nThe 2019 Credit Agreement is a senior unsecured credit facility. As of September 30, 2020, the 2019 Credit Agreement provided for the following: (1) a $2.8 billion incremental revolving credit facility, which includes the capacity to obtain letters of credit and swingline loans and terminates on March 4, 2024; (2) a $300.0 million incremental tranche A term loan facility maturing on March 4, 2024, requiring quarterly principal payments unless our leverage ratio (as defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement) is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding any such payment date; and (3) a \\u20ac400.0 million term loan facility due and payable in full at maturity on December 20, 2023.\\nOn August\\u00a013, 2015, CBRE Services issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due March\\u00a01, 2026 (the 4.875% senior notes) at a price equal to 99.24% of their face value. The 4.875% senior notes are unsecured obligations of CBRE Services, senior to all of its current and future subordinated indebtedness, but effectively subordinated to all of its current and future secured indebtedness. Interest accrues at a rate of 4.875% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March\\u00a01 and September\\u00a01.\\nOn September\\u00a026, 2014, CBRE Services issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due March\\u00a015, 2025 (the 5.25% senior notes). On December\\u00a012, 2014, CBRE Services issued an additional $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due March\\u00a015, 2025 at a price equal to 101.5% of their face value, plus interest deemed to have accrued from September\\u00a026, 2014. The 5.25% senior notes are unsecured obligations of CBRE Services, senior to all of its current and future subordinated indebtedness, but effectively subordinated to all of its current and future secured indebtedness. Interest accrues at a rate of 5.25% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March\\u00a015 and September\\u00a015.\\n45\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nThe indentures governing our 4.875% senior notes and 5.25% senior notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create or permit liens on assets securing indebtedness, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and enter into consolidations or mergers. In addition, these indentures require that the 4.875% senior notes and the 5.25% senior notes be jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior basis by CBRE Group, Inc. and each domestic subsidiary of CBRE Services that guarantees the 2019 Credit Agreement.\\nOur 2019 Credit Agreement, 4.875% senior notes and 5.25% senior notes are all fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed by us and certain subsidiaries (see Exhibit 22.1 for a listing of all such subsidiary guarantors). Combined summarized financial information for CBRE Group, Inc., (parent); CBRE Services (subsidiary issuer); and the guarantor subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the obligated group), which excludes investment balances in non-guarantor subsidiaries as well as income from consolidated non-guarantor subsidiaries, is as follows (dollars in thousands):\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nSeptember\\u00a030,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nDecember\\u00a031,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2019\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance Sheet Data:\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent assets\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n3,129,883\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,901,618\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNoncurrent assets (1)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5,200,369\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5,610,084\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal assets (1)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n8,330,252\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n8,511,702\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent liabilities\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,915,488\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,893,775\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNoncurrent liabilities\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2,215,211\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2,201,269\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal liabilities\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5,130,699\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5,095,044\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nNine Months Ended September\\u00a030,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2019\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nStatement of Operations Data:\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,410,167\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,626,821\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nOperating income\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n207,270\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n439,104\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNet income\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n188,518\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n447,936\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIncludes $303.1 million and $574.6 million as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, of intercompany loan receivables from non-guarantor subsidiaries.

(now known as TFCF Corporation) (\\u201c21CF\\u201d) of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of FOX to 21CF stockholders (other than holders that were subsidiaries of 21CF) (the \\u201cDistribution\\u201d) in accordance with the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 20, 2018, by and between 21CF and 21CF Distribution Merger Sub, Inc. Following the Distribution, 354 million and 266 million shares of the Company\\u2019s Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \\u201cClass A Common Stock\\u201d), and Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \\u201cClass B Common Stock\\u201d and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the \\u201cCommon Stock\\u201d), respectively, began trading independently on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. In connection with the Distribution, the Company entered into the Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of March 19, 2019 (the \\u201cSeparation Agreement\\u201d), with 21CF, which effected the internal restructuring (the \\u201cSeparation\\u201d) whereby 21CF transferred to FOX a portfolio of 21CF\\u2019s news, sports and broadcast businesses, including FOX News Media (consisting of FOX News and FOX Business), FOX\\u00a0Entertainment, FOX Sports, FOX Television Stations, and sports cable networks FS1, FS2, FOX Deportes and Big Ten Network, and certain other assets, and FOX assumed from 21CF the liabilities associated with such businesses and certain other liabilities. The Separation and the Distribution were effected as part of a series of transactions contemplated by the Amended and Restated Merger Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 20, 2018, by and among 21CF, The Walt Disney Company (\\u201cDisney\\u201d) and certain subsidiaries of Disney, pursuant to which, among other things, 21CF became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Disney.\\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company entered into several agreements that govern certain aspects of the Company\\u2019s relationship with 21CF and Disney following the Separation. These include the Separation Agreement, a tax matters agreement, a transition services agreement, as well as agreements relating to intellectual property licenses, employee matters, commercial arrangements and a studio lot lease (See Note 1\\u2014Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the 2019 Form 10-K for additional information).\\nManagement\\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of the Company\\u2019s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations.

The FOX Studios lot, located in Los Angeles, California, provides television and film production services along with office space, studio operation services and includes all operations of the facility.\\nOther Business Developments\\nOn November 6, 2019, the Company announced a stock repurchase program providing for the repurchase of $2 billion of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. The program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company also announced on November 6, 2019 that it had entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction to repurchase $350 million of Class A Common Stock and that it also intends to promptly repurchase $150 million of Class B Common Stock. At the same time, the Company announced that it had entered into a stockholders agreement by and between the Company and the Murdoch Family Trust pursuant to which the Company and the Murdoch Family Trust have agreed not to take actions that would result in the Murdoch Family Trust and Murdoch family members together owning more than 44% of the outstanding voting power of the shares of Class B Common Stock or would increase the Murdoch Family Trust\\u2019s voting power by more than 1.75% in any rolling twelve-month period. The Murdoch Family Trust would forfeit votes to the extent necessary to ensure that the Murdoch Family Trust and the Murdoch family collectively do not exceed 44% of the outstanding voting power of the Class B shares, except where a Murdoch family member votes their own shares differently from the Murdoch Family Trust on any matter.\\nIn November 2019, the Company announced the entry into an agreement with Nexstar Media Group (\\u201cNexstar\\u201d) to acquire three television stations (FOX-affiliate KCPQ and MyNetworkTV-affiliate KZJO located in Seattle, Washington and FOX-affiliate WITI located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin) for approximately $350 million. As part of this transaction, the Company has agreed to sell Nexstar two television stations located in Charlotte, North Carolina, FOX-affiliate WJZY and MyNetworkTV-affiliate WMYT, for approximately $45 million. Completion of the transaction is expected to occur during the first half of calendar year 2020, subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions.\\nIn October 2019, the Company acquired 67% of the equity in Credible Labs Inc. (\\u201cCredible\\u201d), a U.S. consumer finance marketplace, for approximately A$390 million (approximately $260\\u00a0million) in cash (the \\u201cCredible Acquisition\\u201d). In addition, the Company has agreed to commit up to $75\\u00a0million of capital to Credible over approximately two years following the closing of the Credible Acquisition.\\n22\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nRESULTS

meaningful\\nOverview\\u2014The Company\\u2019s revenues increased 5% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber and higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network, partially offset by the impact of a lower average number of subscribers. The decrease in advertising revenue was primarily due to lower political advertising revenue at FOX Television Stations due to the U.S. midterm elections in November 2018, fewer broadcasts of F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (\\u201cFIFA\\u201d) World Cup events and lower ratings for entertainment programming on the FOX Network, partially offset by higher pricing for entertainment programming and the broadcast of the 71st Annual Primetime Emmy Awards on the FOX Network and increased digital advertising revenue. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher digital content licensing revenue at the FOX Network and revenues generated from the operation of the FOX Studios lot for third parties and from Premier Boxing Champions (\\u201cPBC\\u201d) pay-per-view events.\\nOperating expenses decreased 2% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs at the Cable Network Programming and Television segments. The decrease in sports programming rights amortization and production costs was the result of fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events and the absence of Ultimate Fighting Championship (\\u201cUFC\\u201d) content, partially offset by contractual rate increases for the National Football League (\\u201cNFL\\u201d), Major League Baseball (\\u201cMLB\\u201d), college football and PBC content. Partially offsetting these decreases in operating expenses were higher broadcast costs related to operating as a standalone public company.\\n23\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 18% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher costs in fiscal 2020 related to operating as a standalone public company as compared to allocated costs in fiscal 2019 (See Note 1\\u2014Description of Business and Basis of Presentation to the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of FOX under the heading \\u201cBasis of Presentation\\u201d for additional information). In addition, the three months ended September 30, 2019 includes equity-based compensation costs of approximately $15 million related to the grant of restricted stock units and stock options, in connection with the Distribution, under the Fox Corporation 2019 Shareholder Alignment Plan (See Note 11\\u2014Equity-Based Compensation in the 2019 Form 10-K for additional information).\\nInterest expense\\u2014Interest expense increased $74 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to the issuance of $6.8 billion of senior notes in January 2019 (See Note 9\\u2014Borrowings in the 2019 Form 10-K under the heading \\u201cSenior Notes Issued Under the January 2019 Indenture\\u201d for additional information).\\nInterest income\\u2014Interest income increased $17 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a higher average cash balance.\\nOther, net\\u2014See Note 12\\u2014Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of FOX under the heading \\u201cOther, net.\\u201d\\nIncome tax expense\\u2014The Company\\u2019s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 27% and 26% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes and other permanent items.\\nNet income\\u2014Net income decreased 17% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to a decrease in unrealized gains on investments (See Note 12\\u2014Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of FOX under the heading \\u201cOther, net\\u201d) and higher interest expense due to the issuance of $6.8 billion of senior notes in January 2019 (See Note 9\\u2014Borrowings in the 2019 Form 10-K under the heading \\u201cSenior Notes Issued Under the January 2019 Indenture\\u201d for additional information), partially offset by improved Segment EBITDA (as defined below).\\nSegment Analysis \\nThe Company\\u2019s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company\\u2019s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or Segment EBITDA. Due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses.\\nBeginning with the announcement of the Company\\u2019s financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company has renamed as \\u201cSegment EBITDA\\u201d the measure that it previously referred to as \\u201cSegment OIBDA\\u201d. The definition of this measure has not changed: Segment EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, Interest income, Other, net and Income tax expense. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company\\u2019s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company\\u2019s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the Company\\u2019s businesses. \\n24\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nThe following tables set forth the

at the Cable Network Programming segment increased 2% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019. Affiliate fee revenue remained consistent with the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, as higher average rates per subscriber, led by contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals, were offset by the impact of a lower average number of subscribers. The decrease in the average number of subscribers was due to a reduction in subscribers to traditional MVPDs, partially offset by an increase in digital MVPD subscribers. The decrease in advertising revenue was due to lower linear advertising revenue, including the effect of fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events and the absence of UFC content, partially offset by higher digital advertising revenue. The increase in other revenues was primarily attributable to the revenues generated from PBC pay-per-view events and higher sports sublicensing revenue.\\n25\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCable Network Programming Segment EBITDA increased 8% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above and lower expenses. Operating expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2019, primarily due to lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs, including fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events and the absence of UFC content, partially offset by contractual rate increases for MLB and PBC content. Partially offsetting these decreases in operating expenses were higher costs incurred in connection with FOX Nation which was launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.\\nTelevision (51% and 50% of the Company\\u2019s revenues for the first three months of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively)\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nFor\\u00a0the\\u00a0three\\u00a0months\\u00a0ended September 30,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2019\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2018\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nChange\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\u00a0Change\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(in millions, except %)\\n\\n\\n\\nRevenues\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertising\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n787\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n799\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(12\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(2\\n\\n)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nAffiliate fee\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n455\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n398\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n57\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nOther\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n114\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n80\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n43\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal revenues\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1,356\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1,277\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n79\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nOperating expenses\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(943\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(951\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(1\\n\\n)\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nSelling, general and administrative\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(162\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(155\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(7\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nSegment EBITDA\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n251\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n171\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n80\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n47\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nRevenues at the Television segment increased 6% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019. The decrease in advertising revenue was primarily due to lower political advertising revenue at the FOX Television Stations due to the U.S. midterm elections in November 2018, fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events and lower ratings for entertainment programming on the FOX Network. Partially offsetting these decreases in advertising revenue were higher pricing for entertainment programming and the broadcast of the 71st Annual Primetime Emmy Awards on the FOX Network, higher ratings for college football and increased digital advertising revenue. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network and higher average rates per subscriber for the Company\\u2019s owned and operated television stations. The increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher digital content licensing revenue at the FOX Network.\\nTelevision Segment EBITDA increased 47% for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above. Expenses remained consistent with the corresponding period of fiscal 2019, as the decrease in operating expenses was offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs principally as a result of fewer broadcasts of FIFA World Cup events, partially offset by contractual rate increases for NFL and college football content. Partially offsetting these decreases in expenses were higher costs related to operating as a standalone public company.\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\nBeginning with the announcement of the Company\\u2019s financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company has renamed as \\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\\u201d the measure that it had previously referred to as \\u201cTotal Segment EBITDA\\u201d and, prior to the announcement of the Company\\u2019s financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, as \\u201cTotal Segment OIBDA.\\u201d The definition of this measure has not changed: Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, Interest income, Other, net and Income tax expense.\\n26\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nManagement believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company\\u2019s Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company\\u2019s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect Net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company\\u2019s business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors\\u2019 data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).\\nAdjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d). In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company\\u2019s financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\\nThe following table reconciles Net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30,

The Company has an unused five-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (See Note 5\\u2014Borrowings to the accompanying Unaudited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements of FOX) and has access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions.

Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the United States as measured by number of homes closed. We construct and sell homes through our operating divisions in 91 markets across 29 states, primarily under the names of D.R. Horton, America\\u2019s Builder, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes. Our common stock is included in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \\u201cDHI.\\u201d Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms \\u201cD.R. Horton,\\u201d the \\u201cCompany,\\u201d \\u201cwe\\u201d and \\u201cour\\u201d used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.Our business operations consist of homebuilding, a majority-owned residential lot development company, financial services and other activities. Our homebuilding operations are our core business and primarily include the construction and sale of single-family homes with sales prices generally ranging from $150,000 to more than $1,000,000, with an average closing price of $308,800 during the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021. Approximately 91% of our home sales revenue in the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 was generated from the sale of single-family detached homes, with the remainder from the sale of attached homes, such as townhomes, duplexes and triplexes.Our position as the most geographically diverse and largest volume homebuilder in the United States provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales. Our product offerings include a broad range of homes for entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury buyers across our markets. Our entry-level homes at affordable price points have experienced very strong demand from homebuyers, as this segment of the new home market remains under-served, with low inventory levels relative to demand.During fiscal 2020, we also began constructing and leasing homes as income-producing single-family rental communities. After a rental community is constructed and achieves a stabilized level of leased occupancy, we generally expect to market the community for a bulk sale of homes. These operations are reported in our homebuilding segment. During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, we completed our first sale of a single-family rental community representing 124 homes for $31.8 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $14.0 million. At March\\u00a031, 2021, our homebuilding fixed assets included $182.6 million of assets related to 27 single-family rental communities, and our single-family rental platform included 1,650 homes and finished lots, of which 570 homes were completed.At March\\u00a031, 2021, we owned 64% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group Inc. (Forestar), a publicly traded residential lot development company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \\u201cFOR.\\u201d Forestar is a key part of our homebuilding strategy to enhance operational and capital efficiency and returns by expanding relationships with land developers and increasing the portion of our land and lot position controlled under land purchase contracts. Forestar has made significant investments in land acquisition and development over the last few years to expand its business across the United States.Our financial services operations provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily to our homebuyers and sells substantially all of the mortgages it originates and the majority of the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. DHI Mortgage originates loans in accordance with purchaser guidelines and sells substantially all of its mortgage production shortly after origination. Our 100% owned subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies, examination, underwriting and closing services, primarily related to our homebuilding transactions.31Table of ContentsIn addition to our homebuilding, Forestar and financial services operations, we engage in other business activities through our subsidiaries. We conduct insurance-related operations, construct and own income-producing multi-family rental properties, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate oil and gas related assets. The results of these operations are immaterial for separate reporting and therefore are grouped together and presented as other. Our multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease and own multi-family residential properties that produce rental income. We primarily focus on constructing garden style multi-family communities, which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units, in high growth suburban markets. After we complete construction and achieve a stabilized level of leased occupancy, the property is typically marketed for sale. At March\\u00a031, 2021 and September\\u00a030, 2020, our consolidated balance sheets included $394.4 million and $246.2 million, respectively, of assets related to multi-family rental operations. Total assets related to other business activities were $547.5 million and $379.4 million at March\\u00a031, 2021 and September\\u00a030, 2020, respectively.OVERVIEWFiscal Year-to-Date Operating ResultsDuring the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, the number and value of our net sales orders increased 43% and 53%, respectively, compared to the prior year period. During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, our number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 40% and 44%, respectively, compared to the prior year period, and our consolidated revenues increased 45% to $12.4 billion compared to $8.5 billion in the prior year period. Our pre-tax income was $2.2 billion in the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period, and our pre-tax operating margin was 17.9% compared to 13.4%. Net income was $1.7 billion in the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 compared to $916.4 million in the prior year period.In the trailing twelve months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, our return on equity (ROE) was 27.1% compared to 19.1% in the prior year period, and our homebuilding return on inventory (ROI) was 31.2% compared to 20.2%. ROE is calculated as net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the trailing twelve months divided by average stockholders\\u2019 equity, where average stockholders\\u2019 equity is the sum of ending stockholders\\u2019 equity balances of the trailing five quarters divided by five. Homebuilding ROI is calculated as homebuilding pre-tax income for the trailing twelve months divided by average inventory, where average inventory is the sum of ending homebuilding inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five.Within our homebuilding land and lot portfolio, our lots controlled under purchase contracts represent 75% of the lots owned and controlled at March\\u00a031, 2021 compared to 70% at September\\u00a030, 2020 and 64% at March\\u00a031, 2020. Our relationship with Forestar and expanded relationships with other land developers across the country have allowed us to increase the controlled portion of our lot pipeline.COVID-19During March 2020, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (C-19) and the related widespread reductions in economic activity across the United States began to adversely affect our business. However, residential construction and financial services are designated as essential businesses as part of critical infrastructure in almost all of the municipalities across the U.S. where we operate. We implemented operational protocols to comply with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities.During April 2020 when restrictive stay-at-home orders were in place for many markets across the United States, we experienced increases in sales cancellations and decreased sales orders compared to the prior year. However, as economic activity began to resume and restrictive orders were eased, demand for our homes improved significantly during the remainder of fiscal 2020 and has remained strong throughout the first half of fiscal 2021. We believe the increase in demand has been fueled by historically low interest rates on mortgage loans and the limited supply of homes at affordable price points across most of our markets. We were and remain well-positioned for increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lot supply and housing inventory.We believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide us with the flexibility to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to continue to generate strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and manage our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions.32Table of ContentsSTRATEGYOur operating strategy focuses on enhancing long-term value to our shareholders by leveraging our financial and competitive position in our core homebuilding business to maximize the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows, while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to navigate changing economic conditions and make opportunistic strategic investments. We made operational adjustments as a result of C-19; however, our strategy remains consistent and includes the following initiatives:\\u2022Developing and retaining highly experienced and productive teams of personnel throughout our company that are aligned and focused on continuous improvement in our operational execution and financial performance.\\u2022Maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position and controlling our level of debt.\\u2022Allocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify our geographic risk.\\u2022Offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market.\\u2022Modifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand and maintain affordability.\\u2022Delivering high quality homes and a positive experience to our customers both during and after the sale.\\u2022Managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.\\u2022Investing in land and land development in desirable markets, while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each market relative to the local new home demand.\\u2022Continuing to seek opportunities to expand the portion of our land and finished lots controlled through purchase contracts with Forestar and other land developers across the country.\\u2022Controlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors.\\u2022Improving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales and other key operational activities.\\u2022Controlling our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense infrastructure to match production levels.\\u2022Opportunistically evaluating potential acquisitions to enhance our operations and improve returns.\\u2022Ensuring that our financial services business provides high quality mortgage and title services to homebuyers efficiently and effectively.\\u2022Investing in the construction and leasing of single-family and multi-family rental properties to meet rental demand in high growth suburban markets and selling these properties profitably.We believe our operating strategy, which has produced positive results in recent years, will allow us to successfully operate through changing economic conditions to maintain and improve our financial and competitive position. However, we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful, and we may need to adjust parts of our strategy to meet future market conditions.33Table of ContentsKEY RESULTSKey financial results as of and for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, as compared to the same period of 2020, were as follows:Homebuilding:\\u2022Homebuilding revenues increased 41% to $6.2 billion compared to $4.4 billion.\\u2022Homes closed increased 36% to 19,701 homes, and the average closing price of those homes was $313,200.\\u2022Net sales orders increased 35% to 27,059 homes, and the value of net sales orders increased 47% to $8.8 billion.\\u2022Sales order backlog increased 85% to 35,845 homes, and the value of sales order backlog increased 97% to $11.6 billion.\\u2022Home sales gross margin was 24.6% compared to 21.3%.\\u2022Homebuilding SG&A expense was 7.6% of homebuilding revenues compared to 8.3%.\\u2022Homebuilding pre-tax income was $1.1 billion compared to $565.5 million.\\u2022Homebuilding pre-tax income was 17.0% of homebuilding revenues compared to 12.9%.\\u2022Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.9 billion compared to $2.6 billion and $1.0 billion at September\\u00a030, 2020 and March\\u00a031, 2020, respectively.\\u2022Homebuilding inventories totaled $12.9 billion compared to $11.0 billion and $11.1 billion at September\\u00a030, 2020 and March\\u00a031, 2020, respectively.\\u2022Homes in inventory totaled 46,100 compared to 38,000 and 33,400 at September\\u00a030, 2020 and March\\u00a031, 2020, respectively.\\u2022Owned lots totaled 121,500 compared to 112,600 and 118,700 at September\\u00a030, 2020 and March\\u00a031, 2020, respectively.

The percentage increase resulted from improvements of 320 basis points due to the average selling price of our homes closed increasing by more than the average cost of those homes, 10 basis points from a decrease in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments related to prior year acquisitions, 10 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest, partially offset by increased warranty and construction defect costs of 10 basis points.Gross profit from home sales increased to $2.9 billion in the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 from $1.7 billion in the prior year period and increased 330 basis points to 24.4% as a percentage of home sales revenues. The percentage increase resulted from improvements of 300 basis points due to an increase in the average selling price while the cost of our homes closed decreased slightly, 10 basis points from a decrease in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments related to prior year acquisitions, 10 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and 10 basis points due to a decrease in warranty and construction defect costs.We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. These actions could cause our gross profit margins to fluctuate in future periods. If new home demand declines from current levels, we would expect our gross profit margins to also decline.Land/Lot Sales and Other RevenuesLand/lot sales and other revenues from our homebuilding operations were $17.3 million and $37.2 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, and $15.5 million and $35.2 million in the comparable periods of fiscal 2020. We continually evaluate our land and lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. We generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them. However, some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers.\\u00a0We may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons. As of March\\u00a031, 2021, our homebuilding operations had $24.1 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months.41Table of ContentsInventory and Land Option ChargesAt the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and perform detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary. As of March\\u00a031, 2021, we determined that no communities were impaired, and no impairment charges were recorded during the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021. During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, impairment charges totaled $5.6 million. There were $1.7 million of impairment charges recorded in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.As we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows, we may modify our pricing and incentives, construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment. If the housing market or economic conditions are adversely affected for a prolonged period due to C-19 or otherwise, we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. These evaluations could result in additional impairment charges which could be significant.During the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs related to land purchase contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate were $3.2 million and $5.6 million, respectively, compared to $7.1 million and $10.7 million in the same periods of fiscal 2020.Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) ExpenseSG&A expense from homebuilding activities increased 30% to $469.5 million and 28% to $920.6 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, from $361.8 million and $720.2 million in the prior year periods. SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 7.6% and 7.7% in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to 8.3% and 8.7% in the prior year periods.Employee compensation and related costs represented 81% and 80% of SG&A costs in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to 73% in both prior year periods. These costs increased 44% to $382.3 million and 40% to $738.3 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, from $265.7 million and $527.7 million in the prior year periods. Our homebuilding operations employed 7,916 and 6,987 employees at March\\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively.We attempt to control our SG&A costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations; however, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues.Interest IncurredWe capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. Interest incurred by our homebuilding operations was $22.6 million and $47.0 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to $22.9 million and $47.2 million in the prior year periods. Interest charged to cost of sales was 0.7% and 0.8% of total cost of sales (excluding inventory and land option charges) in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to 0.8% in both prior year periods.Gain on Sale of AssetsDuring the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, we sold one single-family rental community representing 124 homes for $31.8 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $13.1 million in our homebuilding segment and $0.9 million in our other businesses.42Table of ContentsOther IncomeOther income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations was $1.8 million and $3.3 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to $4.1 million and $9.6 million in the prior year periods. Other income consists of interest income and various other types of ancillary income, gains, expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes, land and lots. The activities that result in this ancillary income are not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.Business AcquisitionIn October 2020, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Braselton Homes in Corpus Christi, Texas for approximately $23.0 million in cash. The assets acquired included approximately 90 homes in inventory, 95 lots and control of approximately 840 additional lots through purchase contracts. We also acquired a sales order backlog of approximately 125 homes.43Table of ContentsHomebuilding Results by Reporting Region\\u00a0\\u00a0Three Months Ended March 31,\\u00a020212020\\u00a0HomebuildingRevenuesHomebuildingPre-taxIncome (1)% ofRevenuesHomebuildingRevenuesHomebuildingPre-taxIncome (1)% ofRevenues\\u00a0(In millions)East$861.5\\u00a0$146.0\\u00a016.9\\u00a0%$579.7\\u00a0$73.3\\u00a012.6\\u00a0%Midwest468.4\\u00a060.9\\u00a013.0\\u00a0%308.7\\u00a023.6\\u00a07.6\\u00a0%Southeast2,054.9\\u00a0376.7\\u00a018.3\\u00a0%1,316.7\\u00a0187.8\\u00a014.3\\u00a0%South Central1,504.1\\u00a0266.8\\u00a017.7\\u00a0%1,066.4\\u00a0156.2\\u00a014.6\\u00a0%Southwest243.1\\u00a039.5\\u00a016.2\\u00a0%199.7\\u00a030.8\\u00a015.4\\u00a0%West1,055.7\\u00a0162.2\\u00a015.4\\u00a0%907.6\\u00a093.8\\u00a010.3\\u00a0%$6,187.7\\u00a0$1,052.1\\u00a017.0\\u00a0%$4,378.8\\u00a0$565.5\\u00a012.9\\u00a0%\\u00a0Six Months Ended March 31,\\u00a020212020\\u00a0HomebuildingRevenuesHomebuildingPre-taxIncome (1)% ofRevenuesHomebuildingRevenuesHomebuildingPre-taxIncome (1)% ofRevenues\\u00a0(In millions)East$1,670.7\\u00a0$278.5\\u00a016.7\\u00a0%$1,100.2\\u00a0$133.2\\u00a012.1\\u00a0%Midwest881.5\\u00a0110.1\\u00a012.5\\u00a0%591.3\\u00a042.3\\u00a07.2\\u00a0%Southeast3,833.3\\u00a0682.5\\u00a017.8\\u00a0%2,467.3\\u00a0333.9\\u00a013.5\\u00a0%South Central2,979.0\\u00a0531.5\\u00a017.8\\u00a0%2,025.1\\u00a0288.9\\u00a014.3\\u00a0%Southwest475.7\\u00a078.1\\u00a016.4\\u00a0%410.7\\u00a065.3\\u00a015.9\\u00a0%West2,066.1\\u00a0306.6\\u00a014.8\\u00a0%1,667.2\\u00a0163.5\\u00a09.8\\u00a0%$11,906.3\\u00a0$1,987.3\\u00a016.7\\u00a0%$8,261.8\\u00a0$1,027.1\\u00a012.4\\u00a0%\\u00a0______________(1)Expenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of interest and property taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our corporate office.

In the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, the volume of first-lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers increased 36% and 43%, respectively, from the prior year periods, due to increases in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations of 36% and 40%. In the six month period, a 2% increase in the percentage of homes closed for which DHI Mortgage handled our homebuyers\\u2019 financing also contributed to the increase in loan origination volume.Homes closed by our homebuilding operations constituted 98% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in both the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 compared to 98% and 97%, respectively, in the prior year periods. These percentages reflect DHI Mortgage\\u2019s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations.The number of loans sold increased 41% and 47% in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. Virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on March\\u00a031, 2021 were eligible for sale to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, approximately 54% of our mortgage loans were sold directly to Fannie Mae or into securities backed by Ginnie Mae, and 37% were sold to two other major financial entities. Changes in market conditions could result in a greater concentration of our mortgage sales in future periods to fewer financial entities and directly to Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae, and we may need to make other adjustments to our mortgage operations.Due to the disruption in the secondary mortgage markets beginning in late March 2020 caused by C-19 and the uncertainty of the impact of the CARES Act, many financial entities began offering lower pricing and limiting their purchases of mortgages and servicing rights. As a result of the rapid decline in servicing values at the end of March 2020, we began retaining the servicing rights on a portion of our loan originations. Servicing values have since improved, and we sold a portion of our retained mortgage servicing rights in the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021. We expect to continue retaining some servicing rights prior to selling them to third parties, typically within six months of loan origination.Financial Services Revenues and ExpensesRevenues from our mortgage operations increased 135% to $190.3 million and 112% to $342.7 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, from $80.9 million and $162.0 million in the prior year periods, primarily due to increases of 35% and 42% in loan originations and higher net gains achieved on the sale of loan originations in the secondary market. Revenues from our title operations increased 47% to $34.8 million and 53% to $69.6 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, from $23.6 million and $45.4 million in the prior year periods, primarily due to increases of 41% and 46% in escrow closings.General and administrative (G&A) expense related to our financial services operations increased 44% to $123.7 million and 42% to $233.3 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, from $85.9 million and $163.8 million in the prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to increases in employee related costs to support a higher volume of transactions. Our financial services operations employed 2,578 and 1,934 employees at March\\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively.As a percentage of financial services revenues, G&A expense was 55.0% and 56.6% in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to 82.2% and 79.0% in the prior year periods. Our significant increase in loan volume resulted in better G&A leverage in the current year periods. However, fluctuations in financial services G&A expense as a percentage of revenues can occur because some components of revenue fluctuate differently than loan volumes, and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned.Other income, net of other expense, included in our financial services operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary.As a result of the revenue increases from higher volumes of mortgage originations and escrow closings and better leverage of our G&A expenses, pre-tax income from our financial services operations increased 336% to $107.7 million and 247% to $191.8 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, from $24.7 million and $55.2 million in the prior year periods.50Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - OTHER BUSINESSESThe combined pre-tax income of all of our subsidiaries engaged in other business activities was $0.1 million and $2.3 million in the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, compared to $28.0 million and $57.5 million in the prior year periods. Income generated by our other businesses can vary significantly based on the timing of multi-family rental property sales. There were no multi-family rental properties sold during the current year periods. There were two multi-family rental properties sold during the prior year periods, one in November 2019 and another in February 2020, for a total of $128.5 million with gains on sale totaling $59.4 million.Our multi-family rental operations develop, construct, lease and own multi-family residential properties that produce rental income. We primarily focus on constructing garden style multi-family communities, which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units, in high growth suburban markets. After we complete construction and achieve a stabilized level of leased occupancy, the property is typically marketed for sale. At March\\u00a031, 2021, we had eight multi-family rental projects under active construction and four projects that were substantially complete and in the lease-up phase. These 12 projects represent 3,760 multi-family units, including 2,450 units under active construction and 1,310 completed units.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATEDIncome before Income TaxesPre-tax income for the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 was $1.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, compared to $621.3 million and $1.1 billion in the prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to increases in pre-tax income generated by our homebuilding operations as a result of higher revenues from increased home closings and an increase in home sales gross margin.Income TaxesOur income tax expense for the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 was $246.0 million and $485.1 million, respectively, compared to $137.3 million and $228.1 million in the prior year periods. Our effective tax rate was 20.8% and 21.9% for the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 compared to 22.1% and 19.9% in the prior year periods. The effective tax rates for all periods include an expense for state income taxes and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the federal energy efficient homes tax credit. For the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, the retroactive reinstatement of the federal energy efficient homes tax credit reduced our effective tax rate by 2.6%. For the three and six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, a change in the estimate of homes qualifying for the fiscal 2020 retroactive extension of the energy efficient tax credit reduced our effective tax rate by 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.Our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, were $150.2 million at March\\u00a031, 2021 compared to $152.4 million at September\\u00a030, 2020. We have a valuation allowance of $7.4 million and $7.5 million at March\\u00a031, 2021 and September\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, related to state deferred tax assets for net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards that are more likely than not to expire before being realized. We will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state NOL carryforwards. Any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact our effective tax rate.The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets.51Table of ContentsCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYWe have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. Our current levels of cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions.Currently, we are increasing our investments in homebuilding inventories and single-family and multi-family rental properties to expand our operations and grow our revenues and profitability, as well as considering opportunistic strategic investments as they arise. We are also returning capital to our shareholders through dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. We are maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances than in prior years to support the increased scale and level of activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing conditions and opportunities.At March\\u00a031, 2021, our ratio of debt to total capital (notes payable divided by stockholders\\u2019 equity plus notes payable) was 25.7% compared to 26.6% at September\\u00a030, 2020 and 29.2% at March\\u00a031, 2020. Our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital (homebuilding notes payable divided by stockholders\\u2019 equity plus homebuilding notes payable) was 16.8% compared to 17.5% at September\\u00a030, 2020 and 19.2% at March\\u00a031, 2020. Over the long term, we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 35%, and we expect it to remain significantly lower than 35% throughout fiscal 2021. We believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders. We exclude the debt of Forestar and our financial services business because they are separately capitalized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities.We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt obligations, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock and maintain sufficient cash levels to support our other operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. D.R. Horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in August 2018, registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined. Forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in September 2018, registering $500 million of equity securities. At March\\u00a031, 2021, $370.6 million remained available under Forestar\\u2019s shelf registration statement, of which $76.3 million is reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering program. As market conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. We believe that our existing cash resources, revolving credit facilities, mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our near-term working capital needs and debt obligations.Capital Resources - HomebuildingCash and Cash Equivalents \\u2014 At March\\u00a031, 2021, cash and cash equivalents of our homebuilding segment totaled $1.9 billion.Bank Credit Facilities\\u00a0\\u2014 We have a $1.59 billion senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $2.5 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to 100% of the revolving credit commitment. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the Prime Rate or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin, as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility. The maturity date of the facility is October\\u00a02, 2024. At March\\u00a031, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding and $143.6 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $1.45 billion.In April 2021, our senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility was amended to extend its maturity date to April\\u00a020, 2026. The maturity date may be extended subject to the approval of lenders holding a majority of the commitments. The capacity of the homebuilding revolving credit facility was increased to $2.19 billion with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $3.0 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments.52Table of ContentsIn May 2020, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $375 million 364-day senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $550 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The interest rate on borrowings under the 364-day revolving credit facility may be based on either the Prime Rate or LIBOR plus an applicable margin, as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at March\\u00a031, 2021. This facility is not expected to be renewed upon its maturity on May\\u00a027, 2021.Our homebuilding revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on our operations and activities, including requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level. Both facilities include substantially the same affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreements governing the facilities and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facilities or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. The credit agreements governing the facilities impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At March\\u00a031, 2021, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of our homebuilding revolving credit facilities.Public Unsecured Debt \\u2014 We have $2.55 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes outstanding as of March\\u00a031, 2021 that mature from September 2022 through October 2027. In October 2020, we issued $500 million principal amount of 1.4% senior notes due October\\u00a015, 2027, with interest payable semi-annually. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of the discount and financing costs is 1.6%. In December 2020, we repaid $400 million principal amount of our 2.55% senior notes at maturity. The indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At March\\u00a031, 2021, we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions associated with our public debt obligations.Repurchases of Common Stock \\u2014 We repurchased 5.5 million shares of our common stock for $420.2 million during the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021.Debt and Equity Repurchase Authorizations \\u2014 Effective July\\u00a030, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities and $1.0 billion of our common stock. At March\\u00a031, 2021, the full amount of the debt repurchase authorization was remaining, and $115.1 million of the equity repurchase authorization was remaining. These authorizations have no expiration date. Effective April\\u00a020, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock, replacing the prior authorization. The authorization has no expiration date.Capital Resources - ForestarThe achievement of Forestar\\u2019s long-term growth objectives will depend on its ability to obtain financing in sufficient capacities. As market conditions permit, Forestar may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to provide capital for future growth and additional liquidity.Cash and Cash Equivalents \\u2014 At March\\u00a031, 2021, Forestar had cash and cash equivalents of $167.2 million. Bank Credit Facility\\u00a0\\u2014 Forestar has a $380 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $570 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $100 million and 50% of the revolving credit commitment. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base calculation based on Forestar\\u2019s book value of its real estate assets and unrestricted cash. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. The maturity date of the facility is October\\u00a02, 2022. At March\\u00a031, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding and $46.0 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $334.0 million.In April 2021, Forestar\\u2019s revolving credit facility was amended to extend its maturity date to April\\u00a016, 2025. The maturity date may be extended subject to the approval of lenders holding a majority of the commitments. The capacity of Forestar\\u2019s revolving credit facility was increased to $410 million with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $600 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments.53Table of ContentsThe Forestar revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. The financial covenants require Forestar to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity and a maximum allowable leverage ratio. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. At March\\u00a031, 2021, Forestar was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its revolving credit facility.Unsecured Debt \\u2014 As of March\\u00a031, 2021, Forestar had $350 million principal amount of 8.0% senior notes due 2024 and $300 million principal amount of 5.0% senior notes due 2028. The notes were issued pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and represent unsecured obligations of Forestar.In April 2021, Forestar issued $400 million principal amount of 3.85% senior notes that mature May\\u00a015, 2026 with interest payable semiannually. The annual effective interest rate of the notes after giving effect to the amortization of financing costs is 4.1%. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes will be used to redeem the $350 million principal amount of 8.0% senior notes due April\\u00a015, 2024 in full, and the remainder of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.In April 2021, Forestar delivered notice for the full redemption of its $350 million principal amount of 8.0% senior notes outstanding. The redemption price of $365.6 million includes a call premium of $14.0 million and accrued and unpaid interest of $1.6 million. The notes are scheduled to be redeemed May\\u00a07, 2021.Forestar\\u2019s revolving credit facility and its senior notes are not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. At March\\u00a031, 2021, Forestar was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its revolving credit facility and senior note obligations.Debt Repurchase Authorization \\u2014 Effective April\\u00a030, 2020, Forestar\\u2019s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30 million of Forestar\\u2019s debt securities. The authorization has no expiration date. All of the $30 million authorization was remaining at March\\u00a031, 2021.Issuance of Common Stock \\u2014 During the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, Forestar issued 1.0\\u00a0million shares of common stock under its at-the-market equity offering program for proceeds of $23.3 million, net of commissions and other issuance costs. At March\\u00a031, 2021, $370.6 million remained available for issuance under Forestar\\u2019s shelf registration statement, of which $76.3 million is reserved for sales under its at-the-market equity offering program.Capital Resources - Financial ServicesCash and Cash Equivalents\\u00a0\\u2014 At March\\u00a031, 2021, cash and cash equivalents of our financial services operations totaled $94.7 million.Mortgage Repurchase Facility \\u2014 Our mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, has a mortgage repurchase facility that provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties upon receipt of funds from the counterparties. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 60 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. In February 2021, the mortgage repurchase facility was amended to increase its capacity and extend its maturity date to February\\u00a018, 2022. The total capacity of the facility is $1.4 billion; however, the capacity increases, without requiring additional commitments, to $1.633 billion for approximately 30 days at each quarter end and 45 days at fiscal year end. The capacity of the facility can also be increased to $1.8 billion, subject to the availability of additional commitments.As of March\\u00a031, 2021, $1.69 billion of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $1.66 billion were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility. As a result of advance paydowns totaling $454.8 million, DHI Mortgage had an obligation of $1.2 billion outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at March\\u00a031, 2021 at a 2.1% annual interest rate.54Table of ContentsThe mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. The facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary\\u2019s minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable leverage ratio and its minimum required liquidity. These covenants are measured and reported to the lenders monthly. At March\\u00a031, 2021, DHI Mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.In the past, DHI Mortgage has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.Operating Cash Flow ActivitiesIn the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $154.9 million compared to $395.1 million in the prior year period. Cash used in operating activities in the current year period primarily consisted of $249.5 million and $32.3 million of cash used in our Forestar and financial services segments, respectively, partially offset by $138.0 million of cash provided by our homebuilding segment.Cash used to increase construction in progress and finished home inventory was $1.3 billion in the current year period compared to $724.4 million in the prior year period. In both periods, the expenditures were made to support increased sales and closing volumes. Cash used to increase residential land and lots in the current year period was $975.2 million compared to $324.2 million in the prior year period. Of these amounts, $377.2 million and $171.4 million, respectively, related to Forestar.\\u00a0The most significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both periods was net income. Also, pursuant to IRS News Release 2021-43, we have deferred approximately $215 million of federal and certain state estimated tax payments originally due March\\u00a015, 2021 until June\\u00a015, 2021 as a result of the Texas winter storm. This deferral provided $215 million of cash from operations during the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021. Investing Cash Flow ActivitiesIn the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $196.1 million compared to $34.6 million in the prior year period. In the current year period, uses of cash included expenditures related to our rental operations totaling $173.9 million, an acquisition of the homebuilding operations of Braselton Homes for $23.0 million and purchases of property and equipment totaling $30.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a single-family rental community for $31.8 million. In the prior year period, uses of cash included expenditures related to our rental operations totaling $113.0 million and purchases of property and equipment totaling $47.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets primarily consisting of $128.5 million related to the sale of two multi-family rental properties.Financing Cash Flow ActivitiesWe expect the short-term financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Long-term financing needs for our homebuilding and Forestar operations may be funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities or equity securities through the capital markets.During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, net cash used in financing activities was $457.2 million, consisting primarily of repayment of $400 million principal amount of our 2.55% homebuilding senior notes at maturity, payment of cash dividends totaling $145.6 million and cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of $420.2 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by note proceeds from our issuance of $500 million principal amount of 1.4% homebuilding senior notes and net advances of $70.9 million on our mortgage repurchase facility.55Table of ContentsDuring the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $453.0 million, consisting primarily of note proceeds of $800 million from draws on our homebuilding revolving credit facility, our issuance of $500 million principal amount of 2.5% homebuilding senior notes, Forestar\\u2019s issuance of $300 million principal amount of 5.0% senior notes and net advances of $297.6 million on our mortgage repurchase facility. Note proceeds were partially offset by repayment of amounts drawn on our homebuilding revolving credit facility totaling $300 million, repayment of $500 million principal amount of our 4.0% senior notes at maturity, Forestar\\u2019s repayment of $118.9 million principal amount of its 3.75% convertible senior notes at maturity, cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock of $360.4 million and payment of cash dividends totaling $128.7 million.During each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2021, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share, the most recent of which was paid on February\\u00a025, 2021 to stockholders of record on February\\u00a017, 2021. In April 2021, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share, payable on May\\u00a020, 2021 to stockholders of record on May\\u00a010, 2021. Cash dividends of $0.175 per common share were approved and paid in each quarter of fiscal 2020. The declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, financial condition and general business conditions.56Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS, COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSOur primary contractual cash obligations are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases. We expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources, cash flows generated from profits, our credit facilities or other bank financing, and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit.At March\\u00a031, 2021, we had outstanding letters of credit of $189.6 million and surety bonds of $2.1 billion, issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have no material third-party guarantees.Our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in Item\\u00a03 \\u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\u201d under Part\\u00a0I of this quarterly report on Form\\u00a010-Q.We enter into land and lot purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot purchase contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment. Among our homebuilding land and lot purchase contracts at March\\u00a031, 2021, there were a limited number of contracts with $80.5 million of remaining purchase price subject to specific performance provisions that may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their respective contractual obligations. Of this amount, $41.5 million related to contracts between our homebuilding segment and Forestar. Further information about our land purchase contracts is provided in the \\u201cHomebuilding Inventories, Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory\\u201d section included herein.57Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATIONAs of March\\u00a031, 2021, D.R. Horton, Inc. had outstanding $2.55 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes due through October 2027 and no amounts outstanding on its homebuilding revolving credit facilities.All of the homebuilding senior notes and the homebuilding revolving credit facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain subsidiaries of D.R. Horton, Inc. (Guarantors or Guarantor Subsidiaries). Each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by D.R. Horton, Inc. Our subsidiaries associated with the Forestar lot development operation, financial services operations, multi-family residential construction and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the homebuilding senior notes or the homebuilding revolving credit facilities (collectively, Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries). The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor and rank equal with all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor and senior to all subordinated debt of such Guarantor. The guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The guarantees will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Guarantors.The guarantees by a Guarantor Subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) the sale or other disposition of its common stock whereby it is no longer a subsidiary of ours; (2) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets (other than to us or another Guarantor); (3) its merger or consolidation with an entity other than us or another Guarantor; or (4) its ceasing to guarantee any of our publicly traded debt securities and ceasing to guarantee any of our obligations under our homebuilding revolving credit facility.The following tables present summarized financial information for D.R. Horton, Inc. and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated among D.R. Horton, Inc. and the Guarantor Subsidiaries, as well as their investment in, and equity in earnings from the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.D.R.

Generally, however, a company would be considered insolvent for purposes of the foregoing if the sum of the company\\u2019s debts, including contingent, unliquidated and unmatured liabilities, is greater than all of such company\\u2019s property at a fair valuation, or if the present fair saleable value of the company\\u2019s assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured.The indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes contain a \\u201csavings clause,\\u201d which limits the liability of each Guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such Guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, it may reduce such Guarantor\\u2019s obligation such that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would not suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due. On the basis of historical financial information, operating history and other factors, we believe that each of the Guarantors, after giving effect to the issuance of the guarantees when such guarantees were issued, was not insolvent, did not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it engaged and did not and has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. We cannot assure you, however, as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESAs disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September\\u00a030, 2020, our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventories and cost of sales, warranty claims and legal claims and insurance. Since September\\u00a030, 2020, there have been no significant changes to those critical accounting policies.As disclosed in our critical accounting policies in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September\\u00a030, 2020, our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims. At March\\u00a031, 2021 and September\\u00a030, 2020, we had reserves for approximately 320 and 260 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, we established reserves for approximately 115 new construction defect claims and resolved 55 construction defect claims for a total cost of $6.2 million. At March\\u00a031, 2020 and September\\u00a030, 2019, we had reserves for approximately 220 and 180 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. During the six months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, we established reserves for approximately 85 new construction defect claims and resolved 45 construction defect claims for a total cost of $18.3 million.SEASONALITYAlthough significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in our homebuilding, lot development and financial services operations. As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.59Table of ContentsForward-Looking StatementsSome of the statements contained in this report, as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the SEC, statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts, stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us, may be construed as \\u201cforward-looking statements\\u201d within the meaning of Section\\u00a027A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section\\u00a021E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Accordingly, you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the information included in our 2019 Annual Report as well as the unaudited financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.\\nIn addition, the statements and assumptions in this Quarterly Report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 or Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, including, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies and prospects as well as estimates of industry growth for the next quarter and beyond. For important information regarding these forward-looking statements, please see the discussion below under the caption \\u201cCautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements.\\u201d\\nOverview\\nCBRE Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation. References to \\u201cCBRE,\\u201d \\u201cthe company,\\u201d \\u201cwe,\\u201d \\u201cus\\u201d and \\u201cour\\u201d refer to CBRE Group, Inc. and include all of its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise.\\nWe are the world\\u2019s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2019 revenue, with leading global market positions in our leasing, property sales, occupier outsourcing and valuation businesses. As of December\\u00a031, 2019, we operated in more than 530 offices worldwide and have more than 100,000 employees, excluding independent affiliates. We serve clients in more than 100 countries.\\nOur business is focused on providing services to real estate occupiers and investors. For occupiers, we provide facilities management, project management, transaction (both property sales and leasing) and consulting services, among others. For investors, we provide capital markets (property sales, mortgage origination, sales and servicing), leasing, investment management, property management, valuation and development services, among others. We provide services under the following brand names: \\u201cCBRE\\u201d (real estate advisory and outsourcing services); \\u201cCBRE Global Investors\\u201d (investment management); \\u201cTrammell Crow Company\\u201d (U.S. development); \\u201cTelford Homes\\u201d (U.K. development) and \\u201cHana\\u201d (enterprise-focused flexible workspace solutions).\\nOur revenue mix has shifted in recent years toward more revenue earned as part of contracts encompassing multiple business lines as occupiers and investors increasingly prefer to purchase integrated, account-based services from firms that meet the full spectrum of their needs nationally and globally. We believe we are well-positioned to capture a substantial share of this growing market opportunity. We generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and commissions on transactions. Our contractual, fee-for-services businesses generally involve occupier outsourcing (including facilities and project management), property management, investment management, appraisal/valuation and loan servicing. In addition, our leasing services business line is largely recurring in nature over time.\\nIn 2019, we generated revenue from a highly diversified base of clients, including more than 90 of the Fortune 100 companies. We have been an S&P 500 company since 2006 and in 2019 we were ranked #146 on the Fortune\\u00a0500. We have been voted the most recognized commercial real estate brand in the Lipsey Company survey for 19 years in a row (including 2020). We have also been rated a World\\u2019s Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute for seven consecutive years (including 2020) and are included in the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index and the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. \\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the outbreak of the widespread novel coronavirus (COVID\\u201119) illness resulted in tremendous amounts of uncertainty, interruption of business activity and significantly impacted global markets. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID\\u201119 a pandemic, pointing to over 118,000 cases of the coronavirus illness in over 110 countries and territories around the world at that time. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, many of our locations and those of our clients are subject to significant operational limitations intended to mitigate the spread of COVID\\u201119 and a substantial subset of our employee population has been transitioned to a remote work environment.\\n22\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCritical Accounting Policies\\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. A discussion of such critical accounting policies, which include revenue recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes can be found in our 2019 Annual Report. There have been no material changes to these policies as of March 31, 2020.\\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\\nSeasonality\\nA significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter, and highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Revenue, earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to year-end. In light of the severe economic dislocations caused by COVID\\u201119, and the resulting uncertainty in the business outlook, the quarterly distribution of financial results in 2020 may not conform with historical patterns.\\nInflation\\nOur commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by inflation. However, to date, we believe that general inflation has not had a material impact upon our operations.\\nItems Affecting Comparability\\nWhen you read our financial statements and the information included in this Quarterly Report, you should consider that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results. We believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future.\\nMacroeconomic Conditions\\nEconomic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly. These include overall economic activity and employment growth, with specific sensitivity to growth in office-based employment; interest rate levels and changes in interest rates; the cost and availability of credit; and the impact of tax and regulatory policies. Periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, will negatively affect the performance of our business.\\n23\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCompensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production. As a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. In addition, when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance, and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved. Additionally, our contractual revenues have continued to increase primarily as a result of growth in our outsourcing business, and we believe this contractual revenue should help offset the negative impacts that macroeconomic deterioration could have on other parts of our business. Nevertheless, adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our consolidated operations and financial condition.\\nSince 2010, commercial real estate markets have generally been characterized by increased demand for space, falling vacancies, higher rents and strong capital flows, leading to solid property sales and leasing activity. This healthy backdrop changed abruptly in the first quarter of 2020 with the emergence of the COVID\\u201119 pandemic and resultant shutdown of economic activity across much of the world, which has led to sharp increases in unemployment, dislocations in debt and equity markets and businesses instituting cost-cutting and capital-preservation measures. There has been a significant impact on commercial real estate markets beginning in the first quarter of 2020, as many property owners and occupiers have put transactions on hold and withdrawn existing mandates, driving lower sales and leasing volumes. We expect to see this trend continue in the second quarter of 2020. For example, in the month of April 2020 our U.S. sales and leasing businesses experienced revenue declines of around 40%. The timing of these impacts varies by geography with Asian markets experiencing the earliest effects from the pandemic, while many other markets did not begin to experience significant effects until the end of the first quarter.\\nReal estate investment management and property development markets have been equally affected by the abrupt macroeconomic, real estate and capital markets changes brought about by COVID\\u201119, which is another trend we expect to continue in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, actively managed public real estate equity funds and programs continue to be pressured by a shift in investor preferences from active to passive portfolio strategies.\\nThe performance of our global real estate services and investment businesses depends on an improvement in macroeconomic conditions, including a return to sustained economic growth, lifting of significant operational restrictions on businesses, solid job creation, stable global credit markets and positive business and investor sentiment.\\nEffects of Acquisitions\\nWe historically have made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add and enhance service competencies around the world. On October 1, 2019, we acquired Telford Homes Plc (Telford) to expand our real estate development business outside the United States (Telford Acquisition). A leading developer of multifamily residential properties in the London area, Telford is reported in our Real Estate Investments segment. Telford was acquired for \\u00a3267.1 million, or $328.5 million along with the assumption of $110.7 million (\\u00a390.0 million) of debt and the acquisition of cash from Telford of $7.9 million (\\u00a36.4 million). The Telford Acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\\nStrategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in strengthening our service offerings. The companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform, or independent affiliates in which, in some cases, we held a small equity interest. During 2019, we completed eight in-fill acquisitions: a leading advanced analytics software company based in the United Kingdom, a commercial and residential real estate appraisal firm headquartered in Florida, our former affiliate in Omaha, a project management firm in Australia, a valuation and consulting business in Switzerland, a leading project management firm in Israel, a full-service real estate firm in San Antonio with a focus on retail, office, medical office and land, and a debt-focused real estate investment management business in the United Kingdom. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we acquired leading local facilities management firms in Spain and Italy, a U.S. firm that helps companies reduce telecommunications costs and a leading provider of workplace technology project management, consulting and procurement services to occupiers across the U.S.\\n24\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nWe believe strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position \\u2013 or expand our capabilities \\u2013 within targeted markets or business lines. In general, however, most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating income and net income as a result of transaction-related expenditures, including severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, as well as costs and charges associated with integrating the acquired business and integrating its financial and accounting systems into our own.\\nOur acquisition agreements often require us to pay deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments, subject to the acquired company achieving certain performance metrics, and/or the passage of time as well as other conditions. As of March 31, 2020, we have accrued deferred consideration totaling $111.3 million, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\\nInternational Operations\\nWe are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID\\u201119 global pandemic on business conditions across all regions in which we operate. COVID\\u201119 has significantly impacted our operations and has the potential to further reduce our business activity (see discussion in the \\u201cRisk Factors\\u201d section in Part II of this Quarterly Report). In addition, we continue to monitor developments related to the United Kingdom\\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) and the uncertainty of the long-term economic and trade relationship between the United Kingdom and European Union. The continued uncertainty has the potential to impact our businesses in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, particularly sales and leasing activity in the United Kingdom. Any currency volatility associated with COVID\\u201119, Brexit or other economic dislocations could impact our results of operations. \\nAs we continue to increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our Real Estate Investments business has a significant amount of euro-denominated assets under management, or AUM, as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe. In addition, our Global Workplace Solutions business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies, such as the euro and the British pound sterling. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our AUM, revenue and earnings.\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2020, approximately 43% of our business was transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies, the majority of which included the Australian dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar and Swiss franc.

As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results. For example, we estimate that had the British pound sterling-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, the net impact would have been a decrease in pre-tax income of $1.0 million. Had the euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the three months ended March 31, 2020, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $1.9 million. These hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into U.S. dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10% change in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations.\\nDue to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. Our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which affect the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. We routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.\\nResults of Operations\\nThe following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019

revenue and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measurements under GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We generally use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. We believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\\nFee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients. We believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the company\\u2019s overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients, and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business.\\nEBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and asset impairments. Amounts shown for adjusted EBITDA further remove (from EBITDA) the impact of certain cash and non-cash items related to acquisitions, certain carried interest incentive compensation (reversal) expense to align with the timing of associated revenue, costs associated with our reorganization, including cost-savings initiatives, and other non-recurring costs. We believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending.\\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our discretionary use because it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. This measure may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt. We also use adjusted EBITDA as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.\\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nThree Months Ended March\\u00a031,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2019\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNet income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc.\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n172,195\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n164,409\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd:\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n113,794\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n105,823\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nAsset impairments\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n75,171\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n89,037\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nInterest expense, net of interest income\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n16,016\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n21,192\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nWrite-off of financing costs on extinguished debt\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2,608\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nProvision for income taxes\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n51,182\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n43,878\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nEBITDA\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n428,358\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n426,947\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nAdjustments:\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nImpact of fair value adjustments to real estate assets acquired in\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0 the Telford Acquisition (purchase accounting) that were sold in\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0 period\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5,753\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nCosts incurred related to legal entity restructuring\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n3,241\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nIntegration and other costs related to acquisitions\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n783\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nCarried interest incentive compensation (reversal) expense to align\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0 with the timing of associated revenue\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(7,784\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n7,336\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nCosts associated with our reorganization, including cost-savings\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0 initiatives (1)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n15,749\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n430,351\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n450,032\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nPrimarily represents severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with our reorganization announced in the third quarter of 2018 that became effective January 1, 2019.\\n27\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2020 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 \\nWe reported consolidated net income of $172.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 on revenue of $5.9 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $164.4 million on revenue of $5.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019.\\nOur revenue on a consolidated basis for the three months ended March 31, 2020 increased by $753.7 million, or 14.7%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. The revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher revenue in our Global Workplace Solutions segment (up 18.3%) and improved revenue in our Advisory Services segment due to property and advisory project management revenue (up 8.7%) and loan servicing revenue (up 23.2%) as well as increased advisory sales (up 11.7%). Higher revenue in our Real Estate Investments segment (up 56.4%) driven by the Telford Acquisition also contributed to the increase. Foreign currency translation had a 0.7% negative impact on total revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily driven by weakness in the Argentine peso, Australian dollar, Brazilian real and euro.\\nOur cost of revenue on a consolidated basis increased by $690.6 million, or 17.2%, during the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our Global Workplace Solutions segment. Higher costs in our property and advisory project management business as well as higher costs in our Real Estate Investments segment (due to the Telford Acquisition) also contributed to the increase. These items were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation, which had a 0.7% positive impact on total cost of revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased from 78.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 to 80.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily driven by our mix of revenue, with revenue from our Global Workplace Solutions segment, which has a lower margin than our other revenue streams, comprising a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior year period.\\nOur operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis were essentially flat at $790.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to $792.9 million for the same period in 2019. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 15.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 to 13.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2020, reflecting the operating leverage inherent in our business. \\nOur depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $8.0 million, or 7.5%, during the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to a rise in depreciation expense of $9.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 driven by technology-related capital expenditures.\\nOur asset impairments on a consolidated basis totaled $75.2 million and $89.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded $50.2 million of non-cash asset impairment charges in our Global Workplace Solutions segment and a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $25.0 million in our Real Estate Investments segment. As a result of the recent global economic disruption and uncertainty due to the novel coronavirus (COVID\\u201119) pandemic, we deemed there to be triggering events requiring testing of certain assets for impairment as of March 31, 2020. Based on these tests, we recorded the aforementioned non-cash impairment charges, which were driven by lower anticipated cash flows in certain businesses directly resulting from a downturn in forecasts as well as increased forecast risk due to COVID\\u201119. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we recorded a non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of $89.0 million in our Real Estate Investments segment. This non-cash write-off resulted from a review of the anticipated cash flows and the decrease in assets under management in our public securities business driven in part by continued industry-wide shift in investor preference for passive investment programs.\\nOur gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis increased by $3.6 million, or 18.6%, during the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. These gains resulted from property sales within our Real Estate Investments segment.\\nOur equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis decreased by $52.0 million, or 71.6%, during the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven by lower equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our Real Estate Investments segment.\\n28\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nOur consolidated interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $5.2 million, or 24.4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. This was primarily driven by an increase in interest income during the first quarter of 2020. \\nOur write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The costs for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were incurred in connection with the refinancing of our credit agreement.\\nOur provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $51.2 million for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020 as compared to $43.9 million for the same period in 2019. Our effective tax rate increased from 20.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 to 22.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2020. On March\\u00a027, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in the United States in response to the COVID\\u201119 pandemic. The CARES Act has not had, nor is it expected to have, a significant impact on our effective tax rate for 2020.\\nSegment Operations \\nWe organize our operations around, and publicly report our financial results on, three global business segments: (1) Advisory Services; (2) Global Workplace Solutions; and (3) Real Estate Investments. For additional information on our segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\\nAdvisory Services\\nThe following

Months Ended March 31, 2020 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2019\\nRevenue increased by $97.1 million, or 5.3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. The revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher sales and loan servicing activity as well as improved property and project management revenue. Foreign currency translation had a 0.8% negative impact on total revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily driven by weakness in the Australian dollar, Brazilian real and euro.\\nCost of revenue increased by $74.9 million, or 6.9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to higher costs in our property and project management business. Higher producer bonuses also contributed to the increase. Foreign currency translation had a 1.0% positive impact on total cost of revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2020. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was relatively consistent at 60.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 versus 59.0% for the same period in 2019.\\nOperating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $9.2 million, or 1.8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. This decrease was largely driven by the overall impact of COVID\\u201119, which resulted in lower bonus and stock compensation expense, partially offset by higher bad debt expense and accruals for losses on loans. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.9% positive impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2020. These items were somewhat reduced by the impact of higher payroll-related costs (partially driven by increased headcount). \\nIn connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans for which the company retains servicing rights, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the retained mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) on the date the loans are sold. Upon origination of a mortgage loan held for sale, the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights to be retained is included in the forecasted proceeds from the anticipated loan sale and results in a net gain (which is reflected in revenue). Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized (within amortization expense) and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. They are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that the servicing income is expected to be received. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, MSRs contributed to operating income $35.6 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $30.5 million of amortization of related intangible assets. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, MSRs contributed to operating income $38.3 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $27.7 million of amortization of related intangible assets.\\n30\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nGlobal Workplace Solutions\\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for our Global Workplace Solutions

March 31, 2020 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2019\\nRevenue increased by $76.3 million, or 56.4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily driven by the Telford Acquisition in our development services line of business as well as higher carried interest revenue and increased asset management fees. Foreign currency translation had a 0.7% negative impact on total revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily driven by weakness in the euro.\\nCost of revenue was $55.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and was attributable to Telford, which we acquired on October 1, 2019.\\nOperating, administrative and other expenses decreased by $6.0 million, or 3.7%, for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily driven lower carried interest expense and lower bonuses in our development services line of business (driven by lower property sales in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, which were reflected in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries). These items were partially offset by higher costs attributable to the Telford Acquisition as well as investments in our new flexible space offering. Foreign currency translation also had a 0.5% positive impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2020.\\n32\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nA roll forward of our AUM by product type for the three months ended March 31, 2020 is as follows (dollars in billions):\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nFunds\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nSeparate\\u00a0Accounts\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nSecurities\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at December 31, 2019\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n40.1\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n64.9\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n7.9\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n112.9\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nInflows\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1.9\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n5.3\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nOutflows\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(0.9\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(4.2\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(0.7\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(5.8\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\nMarket depreciation\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(0.2\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(2.1\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(2.0\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(4.3\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\nBalance at March 31, 2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n40.9\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n61.6\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n5.6\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n108.1\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nAUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures. Our AUM is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees. Our assets under management consist of:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nthe total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing. Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our AUM. The value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost. In the case of real estate operating companies, the total value of real properties controlled by the companies, generally through joint ventures, is included in AUM; and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nthe net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds investments.\\nOur calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nWe believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we incurred $48.9 million of capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions received, which includes approximately $20.0 million related to technology enablement. Given the uncertainty caused by COVID\\u201119, we are not providing an estimate of net capital expenditures anticipated for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 as we are currently re-evaluating such spend, although we currently expect net capital expenditures to be meaningfully lower than initially forecast in our 2019 Annual Report. As of March 31, 2020, we had aggregate commitments of $82.5 million to fund future co-investments in our Real Estate Investments business, $35.5 million of which is expected to be funded in 2020. Additionally, as of March 31, 2020, we are committed to fund $42.7 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our Real Estate Investments business, which we may be required to fund at any time. As of March 31, 2020, we had $2.8 billion of borrowings available under our revolving credit facility.\\nWe have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and general investment requirements (including strategic in-fill acquisitions) and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements. In the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months. Given compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production, the negative effect of difficult market conditions is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. In addition, when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance, and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved. We may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments, as we have done in the past, with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we deem attractive. We may also, from time to time in our sole discretion, purchase, redeem, or retire our existing senior notes, through tender offers, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, or otherwise.\\n33\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nAs noted above, we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing. In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable. However, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions.\\nOur long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, are generally comprised of three elements. The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness. If our cash flow is insufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates. We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.\\nThe second long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions. Our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions. As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had accrued $111.3 million ($37.1 million of which was a current liability) and $111.7 million ($41.6 million of which was a current liability), respectively, of deferred purchase consideration, which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.\\nAs described in our 2019 Annual Report, our board of directors has authorized a program for the company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2019, $400.0 million was available for share repurchases under the authorized repurchase program. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we spent $50.0 million to repurchase, through an existing stock repurchase plan entered into pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, 1,050,084 shares of our Class A common stock with an average price paid per share of $47.62. As of May 7, 2020, we had $350.0 million of capacity remaining under our current stock repurchase program. Our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future stock repurchases with existing cash. We may utilize our stock repurchase program to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program and on a more opportunistic basis if we believe our stock presents a compelling investment compared to other discretionary uses. The timing of future repurchases, and the actual amounts repurchased, will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions and other factors.\\nHistorical Cash Flows\\nOperating Activities \\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled $136.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, a decrease of $256.3 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by a lower overall net increase in working capital during the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019.\\nInvesting Activities\\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $92.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, an increase of $18.3 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019. This increase was largely driven by higher amounts paid for in-fill acquisitions as well as greater contributions to unconsolidated subsidiaries during the three months ended March 31, 2020. These increases were partially offset by higher distributions received from unconsolidated subsidiaries during the three months ended March 31, 2020. \\nFinancing Activities\\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $93.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $300.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease of approximately $393.9 million was primarily due to the impact of net borrowings of $336.0 million from our revolving credit facility in the first quarter of 2019 that did not recur in the first quarter of 2020.\\n34\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nIndebtedness\\nOur level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to pay the principal amount of our indebtedness and other obligations when due. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.\\nLong-Term Debt\\nWe maintain credit facilities with third-party lenders, which we use for a variety of purposes. On March 4, 2019, CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE Services) entered into an incremental assumption agreement with respect to its credit agreement, dated October 31, 2017 (such credit agreement, as amended by a December 20, 2018 incremental loan assumption agreement and such March 4, 2019 incremental assumption agreement, the 2019 Credit Agreement), which (i) extended the maturity of the U.S. dollar tranche A term loans under such credit agreement, (ii) extended the termination date of the revolving credit commitments available under such credit agreement and (iii) made certain changes to the interest rates and fees applicable to such tranche A term loans and revolving credit commitments under such credit agreement. The proceeds from the new tranche A term loan facility under the 2019 Credit Agreement were used to repay the $300.0 million of tranche A term loans outstanding under the credit agreement in effect prior to the entry into this 2019 incremental assumption agreement.\\nThe 2019 Credit Agreement is a senior unsecured credit facility. As of March 31, 2020, the 2019 Credit Agreement provided for the following: (1) a $2.8 billion incremental revolving credit facility, which includes the capacity to obtain letters of credit and swingline loans and terminates on March 4, 2024; (2) a $300.0 million incremental tranche A term loan facility maturing on March 4, 2024, requiring quarterly principal payments unless our leverage ratio (as defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement) is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding any such payment date and (3) a \\u20ac400.0 million term loan facility due and payable in full at maturity on December 20, 2023.\\nOn August\\u00a013, 2015, CBRE Services issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due March\\u00a01, 2026 (the 4.875% senior notes) at a price equal to 99.24% of their face value. The 4.875% senior notes are unsecured obligations of CBRE Services, senior to all of its current and future subordinated indebtedness, but effectively subordinated to all of its current and future secured indebtedness. Interest accrues at a rate of 4.875% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March\\u00a01 and September\\u00a01.\\nOn September\\u00a026, 2014, CBRE Services issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due March\\u00a015, 2025 (the 5.25% senior notes). On December\\u00a012, 2014, CBRE Services issued an additional $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due March\\u00a015, 2025 at a price equal to 101.5% of their face value, plus interest deemed to have accrued from September\\u00a026, 2014. The 5.25% senior notes are unsecured obligations of CBRE Services, senior to all of its current and future subordinated indebtedness, but effectively subordinated to all of its current and future secured indebtedness.

This section should be read together with the unaudited interim combined financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as the audited combined financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2018 and other disclosure included in the Form 10 as amended and filed with the SEC on January 7, 2019 (the \\u201cForm 10\\u201d).\\nINTRODUCTION \\nThe Proposed Distribution\\nOn June\\u00a020, 2018, Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (\\u201cTwenty-First Century Fox\\u201d or \\u201c21CF\\u201d), The Walt Disney Company (\\u201cDisney\\u201d), TWDC Holdco 613 Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Disney (\\u201cNew Disney\\u201d), and certain other subsidiaries of Disney entered into an Amended and Restated Merger Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 20, 2018 (the \\u201c21CF Disney Merger Agreement\\u201d), pursuant to which, among other things, 21CF will merge with and into a subsidiary of New Disney (the \\u201c21CF Merger\\u201d), Disney will merge with and into a subsidiary of New Disney (the \\u201cDisney Merger,\\u201d and together with the 21CF Merger, the \\u201cmergers\\u201d), and each of Disney and 21CF will become wholly-owned subsidiaries of New Disney. A condition to the consummation of the mergers includes the consummation of the Distribution (as defined below). \\nIn connection with the 21CF Disney Merger Agreement and prior to the Distribution, 21CF and its wholly owned subsidiary, Fox Corporation (\\u201cFOX\\u201d or the \\u201cCompany\\u201d), expect to enter into a separation agreement (the \\u201cSeparation Agreement\\u201d), which will become effective on March 19, 2019. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, 21CF will, among other things, engage in the separation (the \\u201cSeparation\\u201d), whereby it will transfer to FOX a portfolio of 21CF\\u2019s news, sports and broadcast businesses, including\\u00a0FOX News,\\u00a0FOX Business, FOX Broadcasting Company (the \\u201cFOX Network\\u201d),\\u00a0FOX Sports, FOX Television Stations Group, and sports cable networks FS1, FS2, FOX Deportes and Big Ten Network (collectively, the \\u201cFOX business\\u201d), and certain other assets, and FOX will assume from 21CF certain liabilities associated with such businesses and certain other liabilities. 21CF will retain all assets and liabilities not transferred to FOX, including the Twentieth Century Fox film and television studios and certain cable and international television businesses. Following the Separation and prior to the completion of the mergers, 21CF will distribute all of the issued and outstanding common stock of FOX to 21CF\\u2019s stockholders (other than holders that are subsidiaries of 21CF) on a pro rata basis (the \\u201cDistribution\\u201d), in accordance with the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 20, 2018, by and between 21CF and 21CF Distribution Merger Sub, Inc. The Separation and Distribution are anticipated to be completed on March 19, 2019 as part of the series of transactions contemplated by the 21CF Disney Merger Agreement (collectively, the \\u201cTransactions\\u201d). Following the completion of the Separation and Distribution, FOX will become a standalone public company. \\nImmediately prior to the Distribution, FOX will pay to 21CF a dividend in the amount of $8.5\\u00a0billion (the \\u201cDividend\\u201d), in immediately available funds. FOX has incurred indebtedness (See Note 5 \\u2013 Borrowings to the accompanying Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of FOX) that will be, together with available cash, sufficient to fund the Dividend, which cash will be replenished and/or indebtedness will be reduced after the mergers by the amount of the Cash Payment (as defined below), if any.\\nAt the open of business on the business day immediately following the date of the Distribution, if the final estimate of the taxes in respect of the Separation and Distribution and divestitures (as well as certain taxes related to the operations of the FOX business from and after January\\u00a01, 2018 through the closing of the Transactions) (collectively, the \\u201cTransaction Tax\\u201d), is lower than $8.5\\u00a0billion, Disney will make a cash payment to FOX (the \\u201cCash Payment\\u201d), which Cash Payment will be the amount obtained by subtracting the final estimate of the Transaction Tax from $8.5\\u00a0billion, up to a maximum Cash Payment of $2\\u00a0billion. After the completion of the mergers, FOX will promptly replenish its cash used, and/or reduce the indebtedness incurred, to fund the Dividend by the amount of the Cash Payment, if any.\\nIn connection with the Transactions, the Company expects to enter into certain other related agreements which govern certain aspects of the Company\\u2019s relationship with 21CF and Disney following the Separation and which will become effective on March 19, 2019. These include (i) a tax matters agreement, (ii) intellectual property license agreements, (iii) a studio lot lease and management agreement, (iv) transition services agreements, (v) commercial agreements and (vi) an employee matters agreement.\\n21\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nIn addition, as a result of the Separation and Distribution, FOX will obtain a tax basis in its assets equal to their respective fair market values, which is expected to result in additional annual tax deductions, principally over the next 15 years.  \\nManagement\\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of the Company\\u2019s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations.

Included is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity available to fund the Company\\u2019s future commitments and obligations, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements.\\nOVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S BUSINESS \\nThe Company is a news, sports and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in the following segments: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nCable Network Programming, which principally consists of the production and licensing of news and sports content distributed primarily through cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators, telecommunication companies and online video distributors (collectively, multi-channel video programming distributors), primarily in the U.S. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nTelevision, which principally consists of the acquisition, marketing and distribution of broadcast network programming nationally under the FOX brand and the operation of 28 full power broadcast television stations, including 11 duopolies, in the U.S. (of these stations, 17 are affiliated with the FOX Network, nine are affiliated with MyNetworkTV, one is affiliated with both The CW Television Network and MyNetworkTV and one is an independent station). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\nOther, Corporate and Eliminations, which principally consists of corporate overhead costs, intracompany eliminations and the FOX Studios lot. The FOX Studios lot, located in Los Angeles, California, provides television and film production services along with office space, studio operation services and includes all operations of the facility. \\nFiscal 2019 Affiliate Fee Outlook\\nThe Company expects the pace of growth of Cable Network Programming affiliate fee revenue to meaningfully decelerate over the remaining six months of the fiscal year compared to the prior year, as the Company lapses prior year contractual rate increases from affiliate agreement renewals.\\n22\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\nResults of

2018, primarily due to higher advertising and affiliate fee revenues. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to the broadcast of National Football League (\\u201cNFL\\u201d) Thursday Night Football (\\u201cTNF\\u201d) on the FOX Network and higher political advertising revenue due to the U.S. midterm elections at the FOX Television Stations Group. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily attributable to higher average rates per subscriber across all networks, led by contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals.\\nOperating expenses increased 20% and 19% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs, including the addition of TNF, partially offset by lower entertainment programming rights amortization as a result of the mix of programming in the current year as compared to the prior year at the Television Segment.\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% and 10% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, primarily due to the increase in revenues which is used to allocate on a pro rata basis certain general corporate expenses from 21CF. The corporate allocations recorded to Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $15 million and $40 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018 (See Note 8 \\u2013 Related Party Transactions and 21CF Investment to the accompanying Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of FOX under the heading \\u201cCorporate Allocations and 21CF Investment\\u201d for additional information).\\nInterest expense \\u2013 Interest expense increased $9 million and $18 million for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, primarily due to a bridge commitment letter which was entered into during fiscal 2018 (see Note 1 \\u2013 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation to the audited combined financial statements in the Form 10 for additional information).\\n23\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nOther, net \\u2013 See Note 12 \\u2013 Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of FOX under the heading \\u201cOther, net.\\u201d \\nIncome tax (expense) benefit \\u2013 The Company\\u2019s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 26% for the six months ended December 31, 2018 was higher than the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state taxes.\\nThe Company\\u2019s effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 included a provisional $624 million tax benefit as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \\u201cTax Act\\u201d) (as described in Note 1 \\u2013 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation to the accompanying Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of FOX under the heading \\u201cU.S. Tax Reform\\u201d).\\nNet income \\u2013 Net income decreased 97% and 50% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, primarily due to the absence of an income tax benefit resulting from the Tax Act in the prior year (as described above), higher costs related to the Separation and Distribution and unrealized losses on investments (See Note 12 \\u2013 Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of FOX under the heading \\u201cOther, net\\u201d). Improved operating results partially offset the decreases in net income for the six months ended December 31, 2018.\\nSegment Analysis \\nThe Company\\u2019s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company\\u2019s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or Segment OIBDA. Due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. \\nSegment OIBDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment OIBDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Impairment and restructuring charges, Interest expense, Other, net and Income tax (expense) benefit. Management believes that Segment OIBDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company\\u2019s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company\\u2019s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the Company\\u2019s businesses. \\nManagement believes that information about Total Segment OIBDA assists all users of the Company\\u2019s Unaudited Combined Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company\\u2019s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Total Segment OIBDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company\\u2019s business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors\\u2019 data, although historical results, including Segment OIBDA and Total Segment OIBDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences). \\nTotal Segment OIBDA may be considered a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.

at the Cable Network Programming segment increased for the three and six months ended December\\u00a031, 2018, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher affiliate fee and advertising and other revenues. The increase in affiliate fee revenue was primarily attributable to higher average rates per subscriber across all networks, led by contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals. The average number of subscribers remained relatively consistent for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018. The increase in advertising and other revenues was primarily due to advertising revenue resulting from higher pricing at the news channels. \\nCable Network Programming Segment OIBDA increased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased principally due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs, including Major League Baseball (\\u201cMLB\\u201d) costs at FS1, launch costs incurred for the Company\\u2019s direct-to-consumer initiatives and higher costs related to news coverage associated with the U.S. midterm elections. Also contributing to the increase for the six months ended December 31, 2018 was the addition of the F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (\\u201cFIFA\\u201d) World Cup and Big Ten programming costs at FS1.\\nTelevision (56% and 54% of the Company\\u2019s combined revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively)

meaningful\\nRevenues at the Television segment increased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher advertising, affiliate fee and other revenues. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to the broadcast of more NFL games due to the addition of TNF and higher political advertising revenue due to the U.S. midterm elections, partially offset by two fewer broadcasts of MLB World Series games in the current year. Also contributing to the increase in advertising revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2018 was the broadcast of a portion of the FIFA World Cup matches in the current year. Affiliate fee revenue increased 25% and 24% for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, primarily due to contractual rate increases on existing affiliate agreements and from affiliate agreement renewals. Other revenue increased 93% and 42% for the three and six months ended December \\n26\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n31, 2018, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher SVOD revenue at the FOX Network. \\nTelevision Segment OIBDA decreased for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal 2018, as the revenue increases noted above were more than offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization and production costs, including TNF, partially offset by lower entertainment programming rights amortization as a result of the mix of programming in the current year as compared to the prior year. Also contributing to the increase in operating expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2018 was the addition of the FIFA World Cup.\\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \\nCurrent Financial Condition \\nHistorically, 21CF provided capital, cash management and other treasury services to the Company and 21CF will continue to provide treasury services to the Company until the Distribution. Prior to December\\u00a031, 2017, substantially all of the cash balances were swept to 21CF on a daily basis and the Company received capital from 21CF for the Company\\u2019s cash needs. Effective January\\u00a01, 2018, the Company ceased participating in 21CF\\u2019s capital and cash management accounts. The Company\\u2019s combined Total assets as of December 31, 2018 and June\\u00a030, 2018 included $2.0 billion and $2.5\\u00a0billion, respectively, in Cash and cash equivalents, which reflects $600\\u00a0million, which was contributed by 21CF in accordance with the 21CF Disney Merger Agreement, plus all net cash generated beginning January\\u00a01, 2018 by the Company\\u2019s business and assets. In accordance with the Separation Agreement, at the time of the Separation and Distribution, the Company will be entitled to such cash amounts reduced by (i)\\u00a0applicable operational taxes, (ii) 30% of all cash dividends declared by 21CF from December\\u00a013, 2017 through the Distribution, (iii) 30% of all unallocated shared overhead and corporate costs from December\\u00a013, 2017 through the Distribution, (iv)\\u00a0an allocated amount of shared overhead corporate costs consistent with 21CF\\u2019s historical approach to such allocation, and (v)\\u00a0certain other expenses related to the Separation and Distribution. The obligations described in clauses (i) - (v) are not fully reflected in the $2.0 billion and $2.5\\u00a0billion in Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 and June\\u00a030, 2018, respectively. The remaining amount of these contractual obligations was approximately $800 million in the aggregate, which was settled in March 2019.\\nThe Company\\u2019s principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds which are highly dependent upon the continuation of affiliate agreements and the state of the advertising markets. In January 2019, the Company issued approximately $6.8 billion of senior notes. In addition, the Company has an unused five-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, an unused $1.7 billion 364-Day Bridge Term Loan Agreement and has access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions. (See Note 5 - Borrowings to the accompanying Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of FOX).\\nThe principal uses of cash that affect the Company\\u2019s liquidity position include the following: the payment of the Dividend, the acquisition of rights and related payments for entertainment and sports programming; operational expenditures including marketing and promotional expenses; expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the cable network and broadcaster and investing approximately $150 million to $200 million in establishing stand-alone technical facilities; employee and facility costs; capital expenditures; acquisitions; and interest and dividend payments.\\nIn addition to the acquisitions, sales and possible acquisitions disclosed elsewhere, the Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and assets. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the Company\\u2019s securities or the assumption of additional indebtedness. \\nSources and Uses of Cash \\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in millions): \\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor\\u00a0the\\u00a0six months\\u00a0ended December 31,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2018\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(35\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nThe change in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018, is primarily due to higher cash receipts from political advertising revenue due to the U.S. midterm elections at the FOX Television Stations Group. \\n27\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in millions): \\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor\\u00a0the\\u00a0six months\\u00a0ended December 31,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2018\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(251\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n239\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nThe change in net cash (used in) provided by investing activities during the six months ended December\\u00a031, 2018, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018, was primarily due to the absence of cash received from the Federal Communications Commission\\u2019s completed reverse auction for broadcast spectrum and the investments in Caffeine, Inc. and Caffeine Studio, LLC (See Note 2 - Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of FOX).\\nNet cash used in financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in millions): \\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor\\u00a0the\\u00a0six months\\u00a0ended December 31,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2018\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNet cash used in financing activities\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(334\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(167\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities during the six months ended December\\u00a031, 2018, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2018, was primarily due to net transfers to 21CF of $312 million in the six months ended December 31, 2018 as compared to net transfers to 21CF of $130 million in the six months ended December 31, 2017. The nature of activities included in net transfers to 21CF includes financing activities, capital transfers, cash sweeps, other treasury services and corporate expenses. Prior to December 31, 2017, the majority of the cash balances were swept to 21CF on a daily basis and the Company received capital from 21CF for the Company\\u2019s cash needs. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company ceased participating in 21CF\\u2019s capital and cash management accounts.\\nDebt Instruments\\nIn January 2019, the Company issued approximately $6.8 billion of senior notes (See Note 5 - Borrowings to the accompanying Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of FOX).\\nRevolving Credit Agreement\\nIn March 2019, the Company entered into an unsecured $1.0 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of March 2024 (See Note 5 \\u2013 Borrowings to the accompanying Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of FOX).\\nBridge Credit Agreement\\nIn March 2019, the Company entered into an unsecured $1.7 billion 364-Day Bridge Term Loan Agreement (See Note 5 \\u2013 Borrowings to the accompanying Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of FOX).\\nCommitments, Contingent Guarantees and Contingencies \\nSee Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies to the accompanying Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of FOX.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \\nSee Note 1 - Description of Business and Basis of Presentation to the accompanying Unaudited Combined Financial Statements of FOX under the heading \\u201cRecently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Guidance and U.S. Tax Reform.\\u201d \\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\\nThis document contains \\u201cforward-looking statements\\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Pending Accounting StandardsIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \\u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses,\\u201d which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information in determining credit loss estimates. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning October\\u00a01, 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, \\u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other,\\u201d which simplifies the measurement of goodwill impairment by removing the second step of the goodwill impairment test and requires the determination of the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit. Under the new guidance, goodwill impairment is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit\\u2019s carrying amount exceeds its fair value with the loss recognized limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning October\\u00a01, 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 related to simplifying the accounting for income taxes.\\u00a0The guidance is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2021, although early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, and it is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, \\u201cReference Rate Reform,\\u201d which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance was effective beginning March 12, 2020 and can be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. The Company will adopt this standard when LIBOR is discontinued, and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.9Table of Contents D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) \\u2013 (Continued)June 30, 2020NOTE B \\u2013 SEGMENT INFORMATIONThe Company is a national homebuilder that is primarily engaged in the acquisition and development of land and the construction and sale of residential homes, with operations in 88 markets across 29 states. The Company\\u2019s operating segments are its 52 homebuilding divisions, its majority-owned Forestar residential lot development operations, its financial services operations and its other business activities. The Company\\u2019s reporting segments are its homebuilding reporting segments, its Forestar lot development segment and its financial services segment. The homebuilding operating segments are aggregated into the following six reporting segments: East, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, Southwest and West. These reporting segments have homebuilding operations located in the following states:East:Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only), Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and VirginiaMidwest:Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota and OhioSoutheast:Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and TennesseeSouth Central:Louisiana, Oklahoma and TexasSouthwest:Arizona and New MexicoWest:California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and WashingtonThe Company\\u2019s homebuilding divisions design, build and sell single-family detached homes on lots they develop and on fully developed lots purchased ready for home construction. To a lesser extent, the homebuilding divisions also build and sell attached homes, such as townhomes, duplexes and triplexes. Most of the revenue generated by the Company\\u2019s homebuilding operations is from the sale of completed homes and to a lesser extent from the sale of land and lots.The Forestar segment is a residential lot development company with operations in 51 markets across 22 states. Forestar has made significant investments in land acquisition and development to expand its business across the United States. The homebuilding divisions acquire finished lots from Forestar in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies. Forestar\\u2019s segment results are presented on their historical cost basis, consistent with the manner in which management evaluates segment performance.The Company\\u2019s financial services segment provides mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of the Company\\u2019s homebuilding markets. The segment generates the substantial majority of its revenues from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance agency and closing services. The Company sells substantially all of the mortgages it originates and the majority of the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers.In addition to its homebuilding, Forestar and financial services operations, the Company has subsidiaries that engage in other business activities. These subsidiaries conduct insurance-related operations, construct and own income-producing multi-family rental properties, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate oil and gas related assets. The operating results of these subsidiaries are immaterial for separate reporting and therefore are grouped together and presented as other. One of these subsidiaries, DHI Communities, constructs multi-family rental properties and had four projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at June\\u00a030, 2020. DHI Communities sold two multi-family rental properties during the current fiscal year, one in November 2019 and another in February 2020, for a total of $128.5 million and recorded gains on sale totaling $59.4 million. At June\\u00a030, 2020 and September\\u00a030, 2019, the consolidated balance sheets included $224.8 million and $204.0 million, respectively, of assets owned by DHI Communities.10Table of Contents D.R.

HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) \\u2013 (Continued)June 30, 2020NOTE C \\u2013 INVENTORIESAt the end of each quarter, the Company reviews the performance and outlook for all of its communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and performs detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary. As of June\\u00a030, 2020, the Company performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities and land inventories with a combined carrying value of $52.1 million and determined that no communities or land inventories were impaired. Accordingly, no impairment charges were recorded during the three months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 compared to $6.8 million of impairment charges recorded in the prior year period. During the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 and 2019, impairment charges totaled $1.7 million and $18.6 million, respectively. Inventory impairments and the land option charges discussed below are included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.As the Company manages its inventory investments across its operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows, it may modify its pricing and incentives, construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment. During the latter part of March and into April, the impacts of the COVID-19 (C-19) pandemic and the related widespread reductions in economic activity began to adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business operations and the demand for its homes. Although demand for the Company\\u2019s homes was strong in May and June, there is significant uncertainty regarding the extent to which and how long C-19 and its related effects will impact the U.S. economy and level of employment, capital markets, secondary mortgage markets, consumer confidence, demand for the Company\\u2019s homes and availability of mortgage loans to homebuyers. The extent to which this impacts the Company\\u2019s operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of C-19 and the impact on its customers, trade partners and employees, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the housing market or economic conditions are adversely affected for a prolonged period due to C-19 or otherwise, the Company may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. These evaluations could result in additional impairment charges which could be significant.During the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs related to land purchase contracts that the Company has terminated or expects to terminate were $5.0 million and $16.1 million, respectively, compared to $12.4 million and $22.4 million in the same periods of fiscal 2019.18Table of Contents D.R.

Both facilities include substantially the same affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreements governing the facilities and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facilities or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. The credit agreements governing the facilities and the indentures governing the senior notes also impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At June\\u00a030, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its homebuilding revolving credit facilities and public debt obligations.D.R.

Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base based on Forestar\\u2019s book value of its real estate assets and unrestricted cash. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. At June\\u00a030, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding and $31.6 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $348.4 million.

At September\\u00a030, 2019, mortgage loans held for sale had an aggregate carrying value of $1.1 billion and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $1.0 billion. During the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 and 2019, mortgage loans originated totaled $8.4 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively, and mortgage loans sold totaled $8.0 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. The Company had gains on sales of loans and servicing rights of $116.7 million and $263.7 million during the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, compared to $85.4 million and $218.3 million in the prior year periods. Net gains on sales of loans and servicing rights are included in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Approximately 93% of the mortgage loans sold by DHI Mortgage during the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 were sold to four major financial entities, of which one entity purchased 36%.In response to C-19, the U.S. government has taken various actions to support the economy and the continued functioning of the financial markets. On March 27, 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), which included changes to current forbearance options for government-backed loans designed to keep homeowners in their homes. Due to the uncertainty surrounding these forbearance options, servicing values declined rapidly at the end of March. The Company began retaining the servicing rights on some of its loan originations during the three months ended June 30, 2020. At June\\u00a030, 2020, the fair value of mortgage servicing rights was $10.0 million and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.The Company also occasionally uses hedging instruments as part of a program to offer below market interest rate financing to its homebuyers in certain markets. At June\\u00a030, 2020, the Company had mortgage-backed securities (MBS) totaling $1.3 billion that did not yet have interest rate lock commitments or closed loans created or assigned and recorded a liability of $11.7 million for the fair value of such MBS position.NOTE H \\u2013 INCOME TAXESThe Company\\u2019s income tax expense for the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 was $149.5 million and $377.6 million, respectively, compared to $153.1 million and $350.5 million in the prior year periods. The effective tax rate was 19.1% and 19.6% for the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, compared to 24.4% and 23.9% in the prior year periods. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 includes a tax benefit of $38.1 million and $77.6 million, respectively, from the enactment of the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 (the Act). The Act retroactively reinstated the federal energy efficient homes tax credit that expired on December\\u00a031, 2017 to homes closed from January\\u00a01, 2018 to December\\u00a031, 2020. The effective tax rates for all periods include an expense for state income taxes, reduced by tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.The Company\\u2019s deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, were $172.2 million at June\\u00a030, 2020 compared to $181.8 million at September\\u00a030, 2019. The Company has a valuation allowance of $13.6 million at June\\u00a030, 2020 and $18.7 million at September\\u00a030, 2019 related to state deferred tax assets for net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards that are more likely than not to expire before being realized. The Company will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to the remaining state NOL carryforwards. Any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact the Company\\u2019s effective tax rate.The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on the Company\\u2019s consolidated results of operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of the Company\\u2019s deferred tax assets.24Table of Contents D.R. HORTON, INC.

The Company\\u2019s warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which it operates and is adjusted to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built and the geographic areas in which they are built.Changes in the Company\\u2019s warranty liability during the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:Three Months EndedJune 30,Nine Months EndedJune 30,\\u00a02020201920202019\\u00a0(In millions)Warranty liability, beginning of period$262.7\\u00a0\\u00a0$213.9\\u00a0\\u00a0$247.3\\u00a0\\u00a0$202.0\\u00a0\\u00a0Warranties issued29.4\\u00a0\\u00a025.8\\u00a0\\u00a075.1\\u00a0\\u00a064.7\\u00a0\\u00a0Changes in liability for pre-existing warranties5.7\\u00a0\\u00a09.4\\u00a0\\u00a014.0\\u00a0\\u00a020.9\\u00a0\\u00a0Settlements made(16.5)\\u00a0(20.1)\\u00a0(55.1)\\u00a0(58.6)\\u00a0Warranty liability, end of period$281.3\\u00a0\\u00a0$229.0\\u00a0\\u00a0$281.3\\u00a0\\u00a0$229.0\\u00a0\\u00a0Legal Claims and InsuranceThe Company is named as a defendant in various claims, complaints and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. At any point in time, the Company is managing several hundred individual claims related to construction defect matters, personal injury claims, employment matters, land development issues, contract disputes and other matters. The Company has established reserves for these contingencies based on the estimated costs of pending claims and the estimated costs of anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes. The estimated liabilities for these contingencies were $461.3 million and $434.7 million at June\\u00a030, 2020 and September\\u00a030, 2019, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Approximately 99% of these reserves related to construction defect matters at both June\\u00a030, 2020 and September\\u00a030, 2019. Expenses related to the Company\\u2019s legal contingencies were $41.1 million and $19.9 million in the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Changes in the Company\\u2019s legal claims reserves during the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:Nine Months EndedJune 30,20202019(In millions)Reserves for legal claims, beginning of period$434.7\\u00a0\\u00a0$408.1\\u00a0\\u00a0Increase in reserves57.1\\u00a0\\u00a045.5\\u00a0\\u00a0Payments(30.5)\\u00a0(12.7)\\u00a0Reserves for legal claims, end of period$461.3\\u00a0\\u00a0$440.9\\u00a0\\u00a027Table of Contents D.R. HORTON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) \\u2013 (Continued)June 30, 2020The Company estimates and records receivables under its applicable insurance policies related to its estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable. Additionally, the Company may have the ability to recover a portion of its losses from its subcontractors and their insurance carriers when the Company has been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies. The Company\\u2019s receivables related to its estimates of insurance recoveries from estimated losses for pending legal claims and anticipated future claims related to previously closed homes totaled $82.4 million, $75.1 million and $69.8 million at June\\u00a030, 2020, September\\u00a030, 2019 and June\\u00a030, 2019, respectively, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.The estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to the Company\\u2019s markets and the types of products built, claim frequency, claim settlement costs and patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. Due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies, actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts, and it is not possible for the Company to make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of its reserves.Land and Lot Purchase ContractsThe Company enters into land and lot purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes. Under these contracts, the Company will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms of many of the purchase contracts, the deposits are not refundable in the event the Company elects to terminate the contract. Land purchase contract deposits and capitalized pre-acquisition costs are expensed to inventory and land option charges when the Company believes it is probable that it will not acquire the property under contract and will not be able to recover these costs through other means.At June\\u00a030, 2020, the Company\\u2019s homebuilding segment had total deposits of $561.9 million, consisting of cash deposits of $517.4 million and promissory notes of $44.5 million, related to contracts to purchase land and lots with a total remaining purchase price of approximately $8.5 billion. The majority of land and lots under contract are currently expected to be purchased within three years. Of these amounts, $97.9 million of the deposits related to contracts with Forestar to purchase land and lots with a remaining purchase price of $1.0 billion. A limited number of the homebuilding land and lot purchase contracts at June\\u00a030, 2020, representing $50.8 million of remaining purchase price, were subject to specific performance provisions that may require the Company to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their respective contractual obligations. Of the $50.8 million remaining purchase price subject to specific performance provisions, $11.5 million related to contracts between the homebuilding segment and Forestar.During the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, Forestar reimbursed the homebuilding segment $7.0 million and $23.2 million, respectively, for previously paid earnest money and $12.9 million and $26.2 million, respectively, for pre-acquisition and other due diligence costs related to land purchase contracts whereby the homebuilding segment assigned its rights under contract to Forestar. During the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2019, Forestar reimbursed the homebuilding segment $10.8 million and $27.6 million, respectively, for previously paid earnest money and $4.7 million and $8.4 million, respectively, for pre-acquisition and other due diligence costs.Other CommitmentsAt June\\u00a030, 2020, the Company had outstanding surety bonds of $1.7 billion and letters of credit of $159.4 million to secure performance under various contracts. Of the total letters of credit, $127.8 million were issued under the homebuilding revolving credit facility and $31.6 million were issued under Forestar\\u2019s revolving credit facility.28Table of Contents D.R.

Interest income earned on mortgage loans held for sale is based on contractual interest rates and included in other income. Mortgage loans held for sale valued using Level 3 inputs at June\\u00a030, 2020 and September\\u00a030, 2019 include $17.7 million and $9.8 million, respectively, of loans for which the Company elected the fair value option upon origination and did not sell into the secondary market.\\u00a0The fair value of these mortgage loans held for sale is generally calculated considering pricing in the secondary market and adjusted for the value of the underlying collateral, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and prepayment risk. The Company plans to sell these loans as market conditions permit.(b)Although the majority of the Company\\u2019s mortgage loans are sold on a servicing-released basis, when the servicing rights are retained, the Company records them at fair value using third-party valuations. The key assumptions used in the valuation, which are generally unobservable inputs, are mortgage prepayment rates, discount rates and delinquency rates, which were 13%, 11% and 5%, respectively, for the three months ended June\\u00a030, 2020.(c)Fair value measurements of these derivatives represent changes in fair value, as calculated by reference to quoted prices for similar assets, and are reflected in the balance sheet as other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The net fair value change for the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 and 2019 recognized in revenues in the consolidated statements of operations was not significant. 30Table of Contents D.R.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) \\u2013 (Continued)June 30, 2020NOTE O \\u2013 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSIn March 2019, the Company assigned its rights under a land purchase contract it entered into in December 2017 to R&R Riverview LLC (R&R), an entity owned by Ryan Horton and Reagan Horton, the adult sons of Donald R. Horton, the Company\\u2019s Chairman. In March 2019, R&R exercised its rights under the purchase contract and paid $77.5 million for 119 acres of undeveloped land in Arizona. In connection with the transaction, Donald R. Horton loaned R&R $77.5 million at a 2.55% annual interest rate and obtained a security interest in the land. Concurrent with the contract assignment to R&R, the Company entered into a land purchase contract with R&R to purchase the 119 acres for R&R\\u2019s cost plus an annualized return of 16%. In accordance with the Company\\u2019s policy on related party transactions, this transaction was reviewed and approved by a committee of the Board of Directors composed of independent directors.The Company determined that R&R was a variable interest entity, and the Company had the power through its rights in its land purchase contract with R&R to control the activities that most significantly impact the entity\\u2019s economic performance, and the Company is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the variable interest entity in its consolidated financial statements by increasing inventory and notes payable by $77.5 million, and this amount was included in those balances at September\\u00a030, 2019.In October 2019, the Company paid R&R $84.2 million for all 119 acres of land and deconsolidated the variable interest entity from the financial statements. The purchase transaction was also reviewed and approved by a committee of the Board of Directors composed of independent directors.32Table of ContentsITEM\\u00a02.\\u00a0\\u00a0MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this quarterly report and with our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September\\u00a030, 2019.

Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the United States as measured by number of homes closed. We construct and sell homes through our operating divisions in 88 markets across 29 states, primarily under the names of D.R. Horton, America\\u2019s Builder; Emerald Homes; Express Homes and Freedom Homes. Our common stock is included in the S&P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \\u201cDHI.\\u201d Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms \\u201cD.R. Horton,\\u201d the \\u201cCompany,\\u201d \\u201cwe\\u201d and \\u201cour\\u201d used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.Our business operations consist of homebuilding, a majority-owned residential lot development company, financial services and other activities. Our homebuilding operations are our core business and primarily include the construction and sale of single-family homes with sales prices generally ranging from $100,000 to more than $1,000,000, with an average closing price of $297,600 during the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020. Approximately 91% of our home sales revenue in the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 was generated from the sale of single-family detached homes, with the remainder from the sale of attached homes, such as townhomes, duplexes and triplexes.During fiscal 2018, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group Inc. (Forestar), a publicly traded residential lot development company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \\u201cFOR.\\u201d Forestar is a component of our homebuilding strategy to enhance operational and capital efficiency and returns by expanding relationships with land developers and increasing the portion of our land and lot position controlled under land purchase contracts. At June\\u00a030, 2020, we owned 65% of Forestar\\u2019s outstanding common stock.Our financial services operations provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily to our homebuyers and sells substantially all of the mortgages it originates and the majority of the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. DHI Mortgage originates loans in accordance with purchaser guidelines and sells substantially all of its mortgage production shortly after origination. Our 100% owned subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing services, primarily to our homebuyers.In addition to our homebuilding, Forestar and financial services operations, we have subsidiaries that engage in other business activities. These subsidiaries conduct insurance-related operations, construct and own income-producing multi-family rental properties, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate oil and gas related assets. The operating results of these subsidiaries are immaterial for separate reporting and therefore are grouped together and presented as other. One of these subsidiaries, DHI Communities, develops, constructs and owns multi-family residential properties that produce rental income. DHI Communities is primarily focused on constructing garden style multi-family products, which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units, in high growth suburban markets. After DHI Communities has completed construction and achieved a stabilized occupancy rate, the property is typically marketed for sale. At June\\u00a030, 2020 and September\\u00a030, 2019, our consolidated balance sheets included $224.8 million and $204.0 million, respectively, of assets owned by DHI Communities. The combined assets of all of our subsidiaries engaged in other business activities totaled $361.3 million and $317.9 million at June\\u00a030, 2020 and September\\u00a030, 2019, respectively.33Table of ContentsOVERVIEWFiscal Year-to-Date Operating ResultsDuring the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, our number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 10% and 11%, respectively, compared to the prior year period, and our consolidated revenues increased 11% to $13.9 billion compared to $12.6 billion in the prior year period. Our pre-tax income was $1.9 billion in the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year period, and our pre-tax operating margin was 13.9% compared to 11.7%. Net income was $1.5 billion in the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. The current nine month period results include a tax benefit of $77.6 million related to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal energy efficient homes tax credit.Cash provided by our homebuilding operations was $1.2 billion in the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 compared to $605.7 million in the prior year period. In the trailing twelve months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, our return on equity (ROE) was 19.9% compared to 17.3% in the prior year period, and our homebuilding return on inventory (ROI) was 21.6% compared to 18.1%. ROE is calculated as net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the trailing twelve months divided by average stockholders\\u2019 equity, where average stockholders\\u2019 equity is the sum of ending stockholders\\u2019 equity balances of the trailing five quarters divided by five. Homebuilding ROI is calculated as homebuilding pre-tax income for the trailing twelve months divided by average inventory, where average inventory is the sum of ending homebuilding inventory balances for the trailing five quarters divided by five.Within our homebuilding land and lot portfolio, our lots controlled under purchase contracts represent 66% of the lots owned and controlled at June\\u00a030, 2020 compared to 60% at September\\u00a030, 2019 and 61% at June\\u00a030, 2019. Our focus on increasing the controlled portion of our finished lot pipeline has benefited from our relationship with Forestar, our majority-owned lot development company.COVID-19During the latter part of March 2020, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (C-19) and the related widespread reductions in economic activity across the United States began to adversely affect our business. However, residential construction and financial services are designated as essential businesses as part of critical infrastructure in almost all municipalities across the U.S. where we operate. We implemented operational protocols to comply with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities.During April 2020 when restrictive stay-at-home orders were in place for many markets across the United States, we experienced increases in sales cancellations and decreases in sales orders, and net sales orders for April were 1% lower than the same month in the prior year. However, as economic activity began to resume and restrictive orders began to be lifted, our weekly sales pace during May and June increased significantly, and our cancellation rate returned to normal levels. In both May and June, our net sales orders increased over 50% compared to the prior year periods. For the third quarter of fiscal 2020, our net sales orders increased by 38% compared to the prior year quarter.We believe the increase in demand in May and June was fueled by increased buyer urgency due to lower interest rates on mortgage loans, the limited supply of homes at affordable price points across most of our markets and to some extent the lower levels of home sales from mid-March through early April, which caused some pent-up demand. We were and remain well-positioned for this increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lot supply and housing inventory, particularly completed homes and those close to completion.However, even with the resurgence of demand in May and June, we remain cautious as to the impact C-19 may have on our operations and on the overall economy in the future. There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent to which and how long C-19 and its related effects will impact the U.S. economy and level of employment, capital markets, secondary mortgage markets, consumer confidence, demand for our homes and availability of mortgage loans to homebuyers. The extent to which this impacts our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of C-19 and the impact on our customers, trade partners and employees, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.We believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide us with the flexibility to operate effectively through these changing economic conditions. We plan to continue to generate strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and manage our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions.34Table of ContentsSTRATEGYOur operating strategy focuses on enhancing long-term value to our shareholders by leveraging our financial and competitive position in our core homebuilding business to increase the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows, while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to navigate uncertain economic conditions and make opportunistic strategic investments. We have made operational adjustments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, our strategy remains consistent and includes the following initiatives:\\u2022Developing and retaining highly experienced and productive teams of personnel throughout our company that are aligned and focused on continuous improvement in our operational execution and financial performance.\\u2022Maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position and controlling our level of debt.\\u2022Allocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify our geographic risk.\\u2022Offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market.\\u2022Modifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand and maintain affordability.\\u2022Delivering high quality homes and a positive experience to our customers both during and after the sale.\\u2022Managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets to adjust to the impact of C-19, while continuing to start construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.\\u2022Monitoring our land acquisition and development investments to adjust to the impact of C-19, while still investing in desirable markets and controlling the level of land and lots we own in each market relative to the local new home demand.\\u2022Continuing to seek opportunities to expand the portion of our land and finished lots controlled through purchase contracts and assist Forestar with its operations, while adjusting the timing of our lot purchases under contract, where necessary, to adjust to the impact of C-19.\\u2022Controlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors.\\u2022Improving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales and other key operational activities.\\u2022Controlling our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense infrastructure to match production levels.\\u2022Opportunistically evaluating potential acquisitions to enhance our operations and improve returns.\\u2022Ensuring that our financial services business provides high quality mortgage and title services to homebuyers efficiently and effectively.\\u2022Investing in the construction of garden style multi-family rental properties to meet rental demand in high growth suburban markets and selling these properties profitably.We believe our operating strategy, which has produced positive results in recent years, will allow us to successfully operate through an uncertain economic environment to maintain and improve our financial and competitive position and balance sheet strength.\\u00a0However, we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful, and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions.35Table of ContentsKEY RESULTSKey financial results as of and for the three months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, as compared to the same period of 2019, were as follows:Homebuilding:\\u2022Homebuilding revenues increased 10% to $5.2 billion compared to $4.8 billion.\\u2022Homes closed increased 10% to 17,642 homes, and the average closing price of those homes was $295,200.\\u2022Net sales orders increased 38% to 21,519 homes, and the value of net sales orders increased 35% to $6.3 billion.\\u2022Sales order backlog increased 41% to 23,205 homes, and the value of sales order backlog increased 41% to $7.0 billion.\\u2022Home sales gross margin was 21.6% compared to 20.3%.\\u2022Homebuilding SG&A expense was 7.9% of homebuilding revenues compared to 8.1%.\\u2022Homebuilding pre-tax income was $709.8 million compared to $561.8 million.\\u2022Homebuilding pre-tax income was 13.6% of homebuilding revenues compared to 11.8%.\\u2022Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.9 billion compared to $1.0 billion and $577.9 million at September\\u00a030, 2019 and June\\u00a030, 2019, respectively.\\u2022Homebuilding inventories totaled $10.9 billion compared to $10.3 billion and $10.7 billion at September\\u00a030, 2019 and June\\u00a030, 2019, respectively.\\u2022Homes in inventory totaled 32,800 compared to 27,700 and 29,200 at September\\u00a030, 2019 and June\\u00a030, 2019, respectively.\\u2022Owned lots totaled 115,200 compared to 121,400 and 118,500 at September\\u00a030, 2019 and June\\u00a030, 2019, respectively.

The value of net sales orders increased 35% to $6.3 billion (21,519 homes) and 27% to $16.3 billion (54,732 homes) for the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, compared to $4.7 billion (15,588 homes) and $12.9 billion (43,435 homes) in the prior year periods. The average selling price of net sales orders during the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 was $294,500 and $298,000, respectively, down 2% and up 1% from the prior year periods.The markets contributing most to the increases in sales volumes in our regions were as follows: the Carolina markets (particularly Myrtle Beach) in the East; the Denver, Chicago and Indiana markets (quarter) and the Denver, Iowa and Indiana markets (nine month period) in the Midwest; the Florida markets (particularly Tampa) in the Southeast; the Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth markets in the South Central; the Phoenix market in the Southwest; and the Portland and California markets in the West.Our sales order cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period) was 22% and 20% in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, compared to 20% and 21% in the prior year periods.During the month of April 2020 when restrictive stay at home orders were in place for many of our markets, we experienced increases in sales cancellations and decreases in sales orders, and our net sales orders for the month were 1% lower than the same period a year ago. However, as some economic activity began to resume and restrictive orders began to be lifted, our weekly sales pace during May and June increased significantly, and our cancellation rate returned to normal levels.Sales Order BacklogAs of June 30,\\u00a0Homes in BacklogValue (In millions)Average Selling Price\\u00a020202019%Change20202019%Change20202019%ChangeEast3,0282,26734\\u00a0%$929.3\\u00a0\\u00a0$675.5\\u00a0\\u00a038\\u00a0%$306,900\\u00a0\\u00a0$298,000\\u00a0\\u00a03\\u00a0%Midwest1,8341,25346\\u00a0%646.6\\u00a0\\u00a0414.0\\u00a0\\u00a056\\u00a0%352,600\\u00a0\\u00a0330,400\\u00a0\\u00a07\\u00a0%Southeast6,6755,05632\\u00a0%1,873.7\\u00a0\\u00a01,409.6\\u00a0\\u00a033\\u00a0%280,700\\u00a0\\u00a0278,800\\u00a0\\u00a01\\u00a0%South\\u00a0Central7,3805,08645\\u00a0%1,920.0\\u00a0\\u00a01,313.4\\u00a0\\u00a046\\u00a0%260,200\\u00a0\\u00a0258,200\\u00a0\\u00a01\\u00a0%Southwest1,34895741\\u00a0%384.8\\u00a0\\u00a0264.8\\u00a0\\u00a045\\u00a0%285,500\\u00a0\\u00a0276,700\\u00a0\\u00a03\\u00a0%West2,9401,88856\\u00a0%1,259.4\\u00a0\\u00a0893.0\\u00a0\\u00a041\\u00a0%428,400\\u00a0\\u00a0473,000\\u00a0\\u00a0(9)%23,20516,50741\\u00a0%$7,013.8\\u00a0\\u00a0$4,970.3\\u00a0\\u00a041\\u00a0%$302,300\\u00a0\\u00a0$301,100\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0%Sales Order BacklogSales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period.

Home sales revenues increased in most of our regions primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed.The number of homes closed increased 10% in both the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 compared to the prior year periods. The markets contributing most to the increases in closing volumes in our regions were as follows: the Carolina markets (particularly Myrtle Beach) in the East; the Denver and Iowa markets (quarter) and the Indiana and Iowa markets (nine month period) in the Midwest; the Florida markets in the Southeast; the Dallas and San Antonio markets (quarter) and the Houston and Dallas markets (nine month period) in the South Central; and the California markets (nine month period) in the West.

The percentage increase resulted from improvements of 120 basis points due to a decrease in the average cost of our homes closed while the average selling price remained flat, 10 basis points from a decrease in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments related to prior year acquisitions and 10 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest, partially offset by a 10 basis point decrease due to increased warranty and construction defect costs.Gross profit from home sales increased to $2.9 billion in the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 from $2.4 billion in the prior year period and increased 140 basis points to 21.3% as a percentage of home sales revenues. The percentage increase resulted from improvements of 130 basis points due to a decrease in the average cost of our homes closed while the average selling price increased slightly, 10 basis points from a decrease in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments related to prior year acquisitions and 10 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest, partially offset by a 10 basis point decrease due to increased warranty and construction defect costs.We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities during this uncertain environment to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. These actions could cause our gross profit margins to fluctuate in future periods. If a prolonged economic recession and a resulting decline in new home demand occur due to C-19, we would expect our gross profit margins to decline from current levels.Land/Lot Sales and Other RevenuesLand/lot sales and other revenues from our homebuilding operations were $14.5 million and $49.7 million in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, and $27.5 million and $49.2 million in the comparable periods of fiscal 2019. We continually evaluate our land and lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. We generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them. However, some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers.\\u00a0We may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons. As of June\\u00a030, 2020, our homebuilding operations had $28.1 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months.43Table of ContentsInventory and Land Option ChargesAt the end of each quarter, we review the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and perform detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary. As of June\\u00a030, 2020, we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities and land inventories with a combined carrying value of $52.1 million and determined that no communities or land inventories were impaired. Accordingly, no impairment charges were recorded during the three months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 compared to $6.8 million of impairment charges in the prior year period. During the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 and 2019, impairment charges totaled $1.7 million and $18.6 million, respectively.As we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows, we may modify our pricing and incentives, construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment. If the housing market or economic conditions are adversely affected for a prolonged period due to C-19 or otherwise, we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. These evaluations could result in additional impairment charges which could be significant.During the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs related to land purchase contracts that we have terminated or expect to terminate were $4.9 million and $15.6 million, respectively, compared to $12.4 million and $22.4 million in the same periods of fiscal 2019.Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) ExpenseSG&A expense from homebuilding activities increased 7% to $415.1 million and 6% to $1.14 billion in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, from $387.4 million and $1.07 billion in the prior year periods. SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 7.9% and 8.4% in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, compared to 8.1% and 8.8% in the prior year periods.Employee compensation and related costs represented 77% and 75% of SG&A costs in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, compared to 73% and 72% in the prior year periods. These costs increased 13% to $320.3 million and 10% to $848.0 million in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively. Our homebuilding operations employed 7,077 and 6,962 employees at June\\u00a030, 2020 and 2019, respectively.We attempt to control our SG&A costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations; however, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or improve upon the current SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues.Interest IncurredWe capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). Capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. Interest incurred by our homebuilding operations decreased 13% to $22.3 million and 17% to $69.5 million in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, from $25.7 million and $83.3 million in the prior year periods. The decreases were due to lower average interest rates on our homebuilding debt, as well as decreases of 1% and 8%, respectively, in our average homebuilding debt during the periods. Interest charged to cost of sales was 0.8% of total cost of sales (excluding inventory and land option charges) in both the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 compared to 0.9% in both prior year periods.Other IncomeOther income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations was $0.2 million and $9.7 million in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, compared to $2.5 million and $6.1 million in the prior year periods. Other income consists of interest income, rental income and various other types of ancillary income, gains, expenses and losses not directly associated with sales of homes, land and lots. The activities that result in this ancillary income are not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.44Table of ContentsHomebuilding Results by Reporting Region\\u00a0\\u00a0Three Months Ended June 30,\\u00a020202019\\u00a0HomebuildingRevenuesHomebuildingPre-taxIncome (1)% ofRevenuesHomebuildingRevenuesHomebuildingPre-taxIncome (1)% ofRevenues\\u00a0(In millions)East$736.3\\u00a0\\u00a0$106.9\\u00a0\\u00a014.5\\u00a0%$675.2\\u00a0\\u00a0$74.1\\u00a0\\u00a011.0\\u00a0%Midwest373.3\\u00a0\\u00a034.1\\u00a0\\u00a09.1\\u00a0%303.3\\u00a0\\u00a018.7\\u00a0\\u00a06.2\\u00a0%Southeast1,629.1\\u00a0\\u00a0233.5\\u00a0\\u00a014.3\\u00a0%1,388.1\\u00a0\\u00a0168.4\\u00a0\\u00a012.1\\u00a0%South Central1,376.4\\u00a0\\u00a0201.8\\u00a0\\u00a014.7\\u00a0%1,178.0\\u00a0\\u00a0164.3\\u00a0\\u00a013.9\\u00a0%Southwest216.1\\u00a0\\u00a029.7\\u00a0\\u00a013.7\\u00a0%240.6\\u00a0\\u00a033.5\\u00a0\\u00a013.9\\u00a0%West890.9\\u00a0\\u00a0103.8\\u00a0\\u00a011.7\\u00a0%976.9\\u00a0\\u00a0102.8\\u00a0\\u00a010.5\\u00a0%$5,222.1\\u00a0\\u00a0$709.8\\u00a0\\u00a013.6\\u00a0%$4,762.1\\u00a0\\u00a0$561.8\\u00a0\\u00a011.8\\u00a0%\\u00a0Nine Months Ended June 30,\\u00a020202019\\u00a0HomebuildingRevenuesHomebuildingPre-taxIncome (1)% ofRevenuesHomebuildingRevenuesHomebuildingPre-taxIncome (1)% ofRevenues\\u00a0(In millions)East$1,836.5\\u00a0\\u00a0$240.1\\u00a0\\u00a013.1\\u00a0%$1,640.9\\u00a0\\u00a0$158.0\\u00a0\\u00a09.6\\u00a0%Midwest964.6\\u00a0\\u00a076.4\\u00a0\\u00a07.9\\u00a0%800.5\\u00a0\\u00a038.8\\u00a0\\u00a04.8\\u00a0%Southeast4,096.4\\u00a0\\u00a0567.4\\u00a0\\u00a013.9\\u00a0%3,607.2\\u00a0\\u00a0411.6\\u00a0\\u00a011.4\\u00a0%South Central3,401.5\\u00a0\\u00a0490.7\\u00a0\\u00a014.4\\u00a0%3,040.8\\u00a0\\u00a0389.6\\u00a0\\u00a012.8\\u00a0%Southwest626.8\\u00a0\\u00a095.0\\u00a0\\u00a015.2\\u00a0%557.5\\u00a0\\u00a069.8\\u00a0\\u00a012.5\\u00a0%West2,558.1\\u00a0\\u00a0267.3\\u00a0\\u00a010.4\\u00a0%2,528.1\\u00a0\\u00a0248.8\\u00a0\\u00a09.8\\u00a0%$13,483.9\\u00a0\\u00a0$1,736.9\\u00a0\\u00a012.9\\u00a0%$12,175.0\\u00a0\\u00a0$1,316.6\\u00a0\\u00a010.8\\u00a0%\\u00a0______________(1)Expenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of interest and property taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our corporate office.

At the time of purchase, the undeveloped land is generally vested with the rights to begin development or construction work, and we plan and coordinate the development of our land into residential lots for use in our homebuilding business. We manage our inventory of owned land and lots and homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in inventory.Our homebuilding segment\\u2019s inventories at June\\u00a030, 2020 and September\\u00a030, 2019 are summarized as follows:\\u00a0As of June 30, 2020Construction in Progress and Finished HomesResidential Land/LotsDeveloped and UnderDevelopmentLand Held for DevelopmentLand Held for SaleTotal Inventory(In millions)East$749.5\\u00a0\\u00a0$502.6\\u00a0\\u00a0$5.4\\u00a0\\u00a0$4.8\\u00a0\\u00a0$1,262.3\\u00a0\\u00a0Midwest480.8\\u00a0\\u00a0432.8\\u00a0\\u00a03.5\\u00a0\\u00a00.7\\u00a0\\u00a0917.8\\u00a0\\u00a0Southeast1,546.6\\u00a0\\u00a01,224.9\\u00a0\\u00a032.1\\u00a0\\u00a01.5\\u00a0\\u00a02,805.1\\u00a0\\u00a0South Central1,514.2\\u00a0\\u00a01,388.7\\u00a0\\u00a00.3\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0\\u00a02,903.2\\u00a0\\u00a0Southwest241.6\\u00a0\\u00a0426.0\\u00a0\\u00a01.6\\u00a0\\u00a00.4\\u00a0\\u00a0669.6\\u00a0\\u00a0West1,229.3\\u00a0\\u00a0873.8\\u00a0\\u00a05.6\\u00a0\\u00a020.3\\u00a0\\u00a02,129.0\\u00a0\\u00a0Corporate and unallocated (1)124.0\\u00a0\\u00a0104.8\\u00a0\\u00a00.6\\u00a0\\u00a00.4\\u00a0\\u00a0229.8\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0$5,886.0\\u00a0\\u00a0$4,953.6\\u00a0\\u00a0$49.1\\u00a0\\u00a0$28.1\\u00a0\\u00a0$10,916.8\\u00a0\\u00a0As of September 30, 2019Construction in Progress and Finished HomesResidential Land/LotsDeveloped and UnderDevelopmentLand Held for DevelopmentLand Held for SaleTotal Inventory(In millions)East$697.1\\u00a0\\u00a0$581.2\\u00a0\\u00a0$10.5\\u00a0\\u00a0$\\u2014\\u00a0\\u00a0$1,288.8\\u00a0\\u00a0Midwest473.9\\u00a0\\u00a0361.1\\u00a0\\u00a01.8\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0\\u00a0836.8\\u00a0\\u00a0Southeast1,434.7\\u00a0\\u00a01,299.9\\u00a0\\u00a031.8\\u00a0\\u00a01.6\\u00a0\\u00a02,768.0\\u00a0\\u00a0South Central1,215.4\\u00a0\\u00a01,317.5\\u00a0\\u00a00.3\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0\\u00a02,533.2\\u00a0\\u00a0Southwest221.8\\u00a0\\u00a0335.6\\u00a0\\u00a01.6\\u00a0\\u00a015.4\\u00a0\\u00a0574.4\\u00a0\\u00a0West1,089.0\\u00a0\\u00a0950.6\\u00a0\\u00a013.9\\u00a0\\u00a02.5\\u00a0\\u00a02,056.0\\u00a0\\u00a0Corporate and unallocated (1)117.1\\u00a0\\u00a0110.2\\u00a0\\u00a00.8\\u00a0\\u00a00.3\\u00a0\\u00a0228.4\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0$5,249.0\\u00a0\\u00a0$4,956.1\\u00a0\\u00a0$60.7\\u00a0\\u00a0$19.8\\u00a0\\u00a0$10,285.6\\u00a0\\u00a0__________(1)Corporate and unallocated inventory consists primarily of capitalized interest and property taxes.47Table of ContentsOur homebuilding segment\\u2019s land and lot position and homes in inventory at June\\u00a030, 2020 and September\\u00a030, 2019 are summarized as follows:\\u00a0As of June 30, 2020\\u00a0Land/LotsOwned (1)Lots ControlledUnderLand and LotPurchaseContracts\\u00a0(2)(3)TotalLand/LotsOwned\\u00a0andControlledHomesinInventory (4)East8,80041,90050,7004,300Midwest8,50015,70024,2002,300Southeast29,60086,300115,9009,700South Central43,10051,90095,00010,600Southwest7,4005,70013,1001,600West17,80018,80036,6004,300115,200220,300335,50032,80034\\u00a0%66\\u00a0%100\\u00a0%As of September 30, 2019Land/LotsOwned (1)Lots ControlledUnderLand and LotPurchaseContracts\\u00a0(2)(3)TotalLand/LotsOwned\\u00a0andControlledHomesinInventory (4)East11,00030,50041,5003,900Midwest8,30010,90019,2002,200Southeast34,80073,300108,1008,900South Central41,60051,40093,0007,900Southwest6,7005,80012,5001,300West19,00014,00033,0003,500121,400185,900307,30027,70040\\u00a0%60\\u00a0%100\\u00a0%___________________(1)Land/lots owned include approximately 36,500 and 36,100 owned lots that are fully developed and ready for home construction at June\\u00a030, 2020 and September\\u00a030, 2019, respectively.

Approximately 29,600 of these lots are under contract to sell to D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under the master supply agreement with D.R. Horton. Approximately 200 of these lots are under contract to sell to other builders.Residential land and lot sales primarily consist of the sale of single-family lots to local, regional and national homebuilders. During the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 and 2019, Forestar\\u2019s land and lot sales, including the portion sold to D.R.

In the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, the volume of first-lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers increased 35% and 33%, respectively, due to increases in the percentage of homes closed for which DHI Mortgage handled the homebuyers\\u2019 financing, as well as increases in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations of 10% in both periods. The percentages of homes closed for which DHI Mortgage handled the homebuyers\\u2019 financing were 71% and 68% in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, compared to 58% and 56% in the prior year periods. Increases in these percentages were primarily due to the Company\\u2019s program to offer below market interest rates to D.R. Horton homebuyers, expanded coverage in certain markets and increased efficiencies resulting from technology advances.Homes closed by our homebuilding operations constituted 97% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 compared to 98% in the prior year periods. These percentages reflect DHI Mortgage\\u2019s consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations.The number of loans sold increased 42% and 32% in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. Virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on June\\u00a030, 2020 were eligible for sale to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). Approximately 93% of the mortgage loans sold by DHI Mortgage during the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 were sold to four major financial entities, of which one entity purchased 36%. Due to the disruption in the secondary mortgage markets beginning in late March 2020 caused by C-19 and the uncertainty of the impact of the CARES Act, many financial entities began offering lower pricing and limiting their purchases of our mortgages and servicing rights. We began retaining the servicing rights on some of our loan originations during the three months ended June 30, 2020. Continued uncertainty could result in a greater concentration of our mortgage sales in future periods to fewer financial entities and directly to Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae, and we may need to make other adjustments to our mortgage operations to adapt to changes in market conditions.Financial Services Revenues and ExpensesRevenues from our mortgage operations increased 34% to $127.7 million and 18% to $289.7 million in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, from $95.5 million and $244.8 million in the prior year periods, while the number of loan originations increased 37% and 35% over those same periods. Revenues increased at a lower rate than origination volume due to lower pricing and resulting net gains on loan originations due to disruption in the secondary mortgage market caused by C-19 and the uncertainty of the impact of the CARES Act, which included changes to current forbearance options for government-backed loans designed to keep homeowners in their homes. Due to the uncertainty surrounding these forbearance options, servicing values declined rapidly at the end of March. The significant decline in servicing values resulted in lower net gains on loan originations during the current year periods compared to the prior year periods even as loan originations increased 37%.General and administrative (G&A) expense related to our financial services operations increased 23% to $93.9 million and 21% to $257.7 million in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, from $76.4 million and $213.4 million in the prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to increases in employee related costs to support a higher volume of transactions. Our financial services operations employed 1,979 and 1,938 employees at June\\u00a030, 2020 and 2019, respectively.As a percentage of financial services revenues, G&A expense was 60.0% and 70.8% in the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, compared to 63.9% and 69.6% in the prior year periods. Fluctuations in financial services G&A expense as a percentage of revenues occur because some components of revenue fluctuate differently than loan volumes, and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned.Other income, net of other expense, included in our financial services operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary.51Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - OTHER BUSINESSESThe combined pre-tax loss of all of our subsidiaries engaged in other business activities was $0.6 million in the three months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 and the combined pre-tax income was $56.9 million in the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, compared to pre-tax income of $24.1 million and $52.6 million, respectively, in the prior year periods. Income generated by our other businesses can vary significantly based on the timing of sales of multi-family rental properties of which there were none during the current quarter.Through DHI Communities, a 100% owned subsidiary, we develop, construct and own multi-family residential properties that produce rental income. DHI Communities is primarily focused on constructing garden style multi-family products, which typically accommodate 200 to 400 dwelling units, in high growth suburban markets. After DHI Communities has completed construction and achieved a stabilized occupancy rate, the property is typically marketed for sale. We had four projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at June\\u00a030, 2020. DHI Communities sold two multi-family rental properties during the current fiscal year, one in November 2019 and another in February 2020, for a total of $128.5 million and recorded gains on sale totaling $59.4 million.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATEDIncome before Income TaxesPre-tax income for the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 was $782.4 million and $1.9 billion, respectively, compared to $626.7 million and $1.5 billion in the prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to increases in pre-tax income generated by our homebuilding operations as a result of higher revenues from increased home closings and an increase in home sales gross margin.Income TaxesOur income tax expense for the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 was $149.5 million and $377.6 million, respectively, compared to $153.1 million and $350.5 million in the prior year periods. Our effective tax rate was 19.1% and 19.6% for the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, respectively, compared to 24.4% and 23.9% in the prior year periods. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020 includes a tax benefit of $38.1 million and $77.6 million, respectively, from the enactment of the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 (the Act). The Act retroactively reinstated the federal energy efficient homes tax credit that expired on December\\u00a031, 2017 to homes closed from January\\u00a01, 2018 to December\\u00a031, 2020. The effective tax rates for all periods include an expense for state income taxes, reduced by tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.Our deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, were $172.2 million at June\\u00a030, 2020 compared to $181.8 million at September\\u00a030, 2019. We have a valuation allowance of $13.6 million at June\\u00a030, 2020 and $18.7 million at September\\u00a030, 2019 related to state deferred tax assets for net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards that are more likely than not to expire before being realized. We will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state NOL carryforwards. Any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods will impact our effective tax rate.The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets.52Table of ContentsCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYWe have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. Our current levels of cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to the recent sudden, significant changes in economic conditions and the housing market across the United States. Currently, we are managing our homes under construction and land acquisition and land development activities to adjust to the impact of the C-19 pandemic on our business across our markets.At June\\u00a030, 2020, our ratio of debt to total capital (notes payable divided by stockholders\\u2019 equity plus notes payable) was 28.0% compared to 25.3% at September\\u00a030, 2019 and 26.4% at June\\u00a030, 2019. Our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital (homebuilding notes payable divided by stockholders\\u2019 equity plus homebuilding notes payable) was 18.4% compared to 17.0% at September\\u00a030, 2019 and 18.5% at June\\u00a030, 2019. Over the long term, we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below 35%, and we expect it to remain significantly lower than 35% throughout fiscal 2020. We believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders. We exclude the debt of Forestar and our financial services business because they are separately capitalized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities.We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt obligations, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock and support other general corporate and operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. D.R. Horton has an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in August 2018, registering debt and equity securities that may be issued from time to time in amounts to be determined. Forestar also has an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in September 2018, registering $500 million of equity securities, of which $394.3 million remains available. As market conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. We believe that our existing cash resources, revolving credit facilities, mortgage repurchase facility and ability to access the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our near-term working capital needs and debt obligations. However, due to the current economic uncertainties related to C-19, we may be limited in accessing the capital markets or obtaining additional bank financing or the cost of accessing this financing could become more expensive for funding our longer-term capital needs.Capital Resources - HomebuildingCash and Cash Equivalents \\u2014 At June\\u00a030, 2020, cash and cash equivalents of our homebuilding segment totaled $1.9 billion.Bank Credit Facilities\\u00a0\\u2014 We have a $1.59 billion senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $2.5 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to 100% of the revolving credit commitment. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the Prime Rate or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin, as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility. The maturity date of the facility is October\\u00a02, 2024. Borrowings and repayments under the facility were $1.06 billion each during the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020. At June\\u00a030, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding and $127.8 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of approximately $1.46 billion.In May 2020, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $375 million 364-day senior unsecured homebuilding revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $550 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The interest rate on borrowings under the 364-day revolving credit facility may be based on either the Prime Rate or LIBOR plus an applicable margin, as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility. The maturity date of the facility is May\\u00a027, 2021. There were no borrowings under the facility for the period from its inception through June\\u00a030, 2020.53Table of ContentsOur homebuilding revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on our operations and activities, including requiring the maintenance of a maximum allowable leverage ratio and a borrowing base restriction if our leverage ratio exceeds a certain level. Both facilities include substantially the same affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreements governing the facilities and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facilities or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. The credit agreements governing the facilities impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At June\\u00a030, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of our homebuilding revolving credit facilities.Public Unsecured Debt \\u2014 We have $2.45 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes outstanding as of June\\u00a030, 2020 that mature from December 2020 through October 2025. In October 2019, we issued $500 million principal amount of 2.5% senior notes due October\\u00a015, 2024, with interest payable semi-annually. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of the discount and financing costs is 2.7%. In February 2020, we repaid $500 million principal amount of our 4.0% senior notes at maturity. In May 2020, we issued $500 million principal amount of 2.6% senior notes due October\\u00a015, 2025 with interest payable semi-annually. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of the discount and financing costs is 2.8%. The indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. At June\\u00a030, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions associated with our public debt obligations.Repurchases of Common Stock \\u2014 We repurchased 7.0 million shares of our common stock for $360.4 million during the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, none of which were purchased in the three months ended June\\u00a030, 2020.Debt and Equity Repurchase Authorizations \\u2014 Effective July\\u00a030, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities and $1.0 billion of our common stock. At June\\u00a030, 2020, the full amount of the debt repurchase authorization was remaining and $535.3 million of the equity repurchase authorization was remaining. These authorizations have no expiration date.Capital Resources - ForestarForestar\\u2019s ability to achieve its long-term growth objectives will depend on its ability to obtain financing in sufficient capacities. As market conditions permit, Forestar may issue new debt or equity securities through the capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to provide capital for future growth and additional liquidity.Cash and Cash Equivalents \\u2014 At June\\u00a030, 2020, Forestar had cash and cash equivalents of $355.6 million. Bank Credit Facility\\u00a0\\u2014 Forestar has a $380 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $570 million, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to the greater of $100 million and 50% of the revolving credit commitment. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base based on Forestar\\u2019s book value of its real estate assets and unrestricted cash. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. At June\\u00a030, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding and $31.6 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $348.4 million. The maturity date of the facility is October\\u00a02, 2022, which can be extended by up to one year on up to two additional occasions, subject to the approval of lenders holding a majority of the commitments.The Forestar revolving credit facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants. The financial covenants require Forestar to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth, a minimum level of liquidity and a maximum allowable leverage ratio. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity.54Table of ContentsUnsecured Debt \\u2014 In February 2020, Forestar issued $300 million principal amount of 5.0% senior notes pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes are due March\\u00a01, 2028, with interest payable semiannually, and represent unsecured obligations of Forestar. The annual effective interest rate of these notes after giving effect to the amortization of financing costs is 5.2%. These notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, subject to certain limitations and premiums defined in the indenture agreement. Forestar also has $350 million principal amount of 8.0% senior notes that mature April\\u00a015, 2024. In March 2020, Forestar repaid $118.9 million principal amount of its 3.75% convertible senior notes in cash at maturity.Forestar\\u2019s revolving credit facility and its senior notes are not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. At June\\u00a030, 2020, Forestar was in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of its revolving credit facility and senior note obligations.Capital Resources - Financial ServicesCash and Cash Equivalents\\u00a0\\u2014 At June\\u00a030, 2020, cash and cash equivalents of our financial services operations totaled $75.1 million.Mortgage Repurchase Facility \\u2014 Our mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, has a mortgage repurchase facility that provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties upon receipt of funds from the counterparties. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 60 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. In May 2020, the mortgage repurchase facility was amended to increase its total capacity to $1.35 billion; however, the capacity increases without requiring additional commitments to $1.575 billion for approximately 30 days at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and first quarter of fiscal 2021 and for approximately 45 days at the end of fiscal 2020. The capacity of the facility can also be increased to $1.8 billion subject to the availability of additional commitments. The maturity date of the facility is February\\u00a019, 2021.As of June\\u00a030, 2020, $1.39 billion of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $1.36 billion were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility. DHI Mortgage had an obligation of $1.2 billion outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at June\\u00a030, 2020 at a 2.4% annual interest rate.The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. The facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary\\u2019s minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable leverage ratio and its minimum required liquidity. These covenants are measured and reported to the lenders monthly. At June\\u00a030, 2020, DHI Mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.In the past, DHI Mortgage has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.55Table of ContentsOperating Cash Flow ActivitiesIn the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $588.9 million compared to $80.7 million in the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities in the current year period primarily consisted of $1.2 billion of cash provided by our homebuilding segment, partially offset by $347.7 million and $205.7 million of cash used in our financial services and Forestar segments, respectively.Cash used to increase construction in progress and finished home inventory was $602.3 million in the current year period compared to $393.0 million in the prior year period. In both periods, the expenditures were made to support increased sales and closing volumes. Cash used to increase residential land and lots in the current year period was $361.9 million compared to $606.2 million in the prior year period. Of these amounts, $259.8 million and $531.5 million, respectively, related to Forestar.\\u00a0The most significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both periods was net income.Investing Cash Flow ActivitiesIn the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $100.4 million compared to $326.3 million in the prior year period. In the current year period, uses of cash included expenditures related to our rental properties totaling $153.6 million and purchases of property and equipment totaling $66.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets primarily consisting of $128.5 million related to the sale of two multi-family rental properties. In the prior year period, the most significant uses of cash were the purchases of the homebuilding operations of Westport Homes, Classic Builders and Terramor Homes. Proceeds from the sale of assets in the prior year period included $133.4 million related to the sale of two multi-family rental properties.Financing Cash Flow ActivitiesWe expect the short-term financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Long-term financing needs for our homebuilding and Forestar operations may be funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities or equity securities through the capital markets.During the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $370.2 million, consisting primarily of note proceeds of $1.06 billion from draws on our homebuilding revolving credit facility, our issuance of $500 million principal amount of 2.5% homebuilding senior notes, our issuance of $500 million principal amount of 2.6% homebuilding senior notes, Forestar\\u2019s issuance of $300 million principal amount of 5.0% senior notes and net advances of $284.0 million on our mortgage repurchase facility. Note proceeds were partially offset by repayment of amounts drawn on our homebuilding revolving credit facility totaling $1.06 billion, repayment of $500 million principal amount of our 4.0% senior notes at maturity, Forestar\\u2019s repayment of $118.9 million principal amount of its 3.75% convertible senior notes at maturity, cash used to repurchase 7.0 million shares of our common stock for $360.4 million and payment of cash dividends totaling $192.3 million.During the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $375.1 million, consisting primarily of repayment of amounts drawn on our homebuilding and Forestar revolving credit facilities totaling $2.0 billion, repayment of $500 million principal amount of our 3.75% homebuilding senior notes at maturity, cash used to repurchase 9.4 million shares of our common stock for $361.5 million and payment of cash dividends totaling $167.9 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by note proceeds of $2.2 billion from draws on our homebuilding and Forestar revolving credit facilities, Forestar\\u2019s issuance of $350 million principal amount of 8.0% senior notes and net advances of $158.8 million on our mortgage repurchase facility. During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors approved and paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.175 per common share, the most recent of which was paid on May\\u00a021, 2020 to stockholders of record on May\\u00a011, 2020. In July 2020, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.175 per common share, payable on August\\u00a024, 2020 to stockholders of record on August\\u00a012, 2020. Cash dividends of $0.15 per common share were approved and paid in each quarter of fiscal 2019. The declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, financial condition and general business conditions.56Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS, COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSOur primary contractual cash obligations are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases. We expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources, cash flows generated from profits, our credit facilities or other bank financing, and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit.At June\\u00a030, 2020, we had outstanding letters of credit of $159.4 million and surety bonds of $1.7 billion, issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have no material third-party guarantees.Our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in Item\\u00a03 \\u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\\u201d under Part\\u00a0I of this quarterly report on Form\\u00a010-Q.We enter into land and lot purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot purchase contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment. Among our homebuilding land and lot purchase contracts at June\\u00a030, 2020, there were a limited number of contracts, representing $50.8 million of remaining purchase price, subject to specific performance provisions that may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their respective contractual obligations. Of this amount, $11.5 million related to contracts between our homebuilding segment and Forestar. Further information about our land purchase contracts is provided in the \\u201cHomebuilding Inventories, Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory\\u201d section included herein.57Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATIONAs of June\\u00a030, 2020, D.R. Horton, Inc. had outstanding $2.45 billion principal amount of homebuilding senior notes due through October 2025 and no amounts outstanding on its homebuilding revolving credit facilities.All of the homebuilding senior notes and the homebuilding revolving credit facilities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by certain subsidiaries of D.R. Horton, Inc. (Guarantors or Guarantor Subsidiaries). Each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries is 100% owned, directly or indirectly, by D.R. Horton, Inc. Our subsidiaries associated with the Forestar lot development operation, financial services operations, multi-family residential construction and certain other subsidiaries do not guarantee the homebuilding senior notes or the homebuilding revolving credit facilities (collectively, Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries). The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of each Guarantor and rank equal with all existing and future senior debt of such Guarantor and senior to all subordinated debt of such Guarantor. The guarantees are effectively subordinated to any secured debt of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. The guarantees will be structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Guarantors.The guarantees by a Guarantor Subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) the sale or other disposition of its common stock whereby it is no longer a subsidiary of ours; (2) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets (other than to us or another Guarantor); (3) its merger or consolidation with an entity other than us or another Guarantor; or (4) its ceasing to guarantee any of our publicly traded debt securities and ceasing to guarantee any of our obligations under our homebuilding revolving credit facility.The following tables present summarized financial information for D.R. Horton, Inc. and the Guarantor Subsidiaries on a combined basis after intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated among D.R. Horton, Inc. and the Guarantor Subsidiaries, as well as their investment in, and equity in earnings from the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.D.R.

Generally, however, a company would be considered insolvent for purposes of the foregoing if:\\u2022the sum of the company\\u2019s debts, including contingent, unliquidated and unmatured liabilities, is greater than all of such company\\u2019s property at a fair valuation; or\\u2022the present fair saleable value of the company\\u2019s assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured.The indentures governing our homebuilding senior notes contain a \\u201csavings clause,\\u201d which limits the liability of each Guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such Guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, it may reduce such Guarantor\\u2019s obligation such that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would not suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due. On the basis of historical financial information, operating history and other factors, we believe that each of the Guarantors, after giving effect to the issuance of the guarantees when such guarantees were issued, was not insolvent, did not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it engaged and did not and has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. We cannot assure you, however, as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard.59Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESAs disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September\\u00a030, 2019, our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, inventories and cost of sales, warranty claims and legal claims and insurance. Since September\\u00a030, 2019, there have been no significant changes to those critical accounting policies.As disclosed in our critical accounting policies in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September\\u00a030, 2019, our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims. At June\\u00a030, 2020 and September\\u00a030, 2019, we had reserves for approximately 240 and 180 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. During the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2020, we established reserves for approximately 120 new construction defect claims and resolved 60 construction defect claims for a total cost of $20.6 million. At June\\u00a030, 2019 and September\\u00a030, 2018, we had reserves for approximately 180 and 155 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. During the nine months ended June\\u00a030, 2019, we established reserves for approximately 80 new construction defect claims and resolved 55 construction defect claims for a total cost of $6.9 million.SEASONALITYAlthough significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in our homebuilding, lot development and financial services operations. As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year. Due to the impact of C-19, our homes closed, revenues and operating income in fiscal 2020 may not follow our historical seasonal patterns.60Table of ContentsForward-Looking StatementsSome of the statements contained in this report, as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the SEC, statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts, stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us, may be construed as \\u201cforward-looking statements\\u201d within the meaning of Section\\u00a027A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section\\u00a021E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Our products run on personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).Adobe was originally incorporated in California in October\\xa01983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May\\xa01997.

Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and syncing of files across users’ machines, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users on account of low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value to Creative Cloud, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably. 40Table of ContentsWe continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.We are also a market leader with our Adobe Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, including Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe Sign. Acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2019 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2019 and held constant throughout the year. We calculate ARR as follows:Creative ARRAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services+ Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value Document Cloud ARRAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services +Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract ValueDigital Media ARRCreative ARR+ Document Cloud ARROn December 1, 2018, the beginning of our fiscal year 2019, we adopted the requirements of the new revenue standard utilizing the modified retrospective method of transition. We began to report our financial results for fiscal 2019 under the new revenue standard. The impact of the adoption was not significant to our results of operations. Creative ARR exiting the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $6.87 billion, up from $5.92 billion at the end of fiscal 2018. Document Cloud ARR exiting the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $993 million, up from $791 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $7.86 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2019, up from $6.71 billion at the end of fiscal 2018.Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $1.65 billion, up from $1.36 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, representing 22% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $307.5 million, up from $248.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as we continue to transition Document Cloud to a subscription-based model. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $1.96 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, up from $1.61 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, representing 22% year-over-year growth. We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. Our Digital Experience business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, marketing automation, audience management, commerce, premium video delivery and monetization. These comprehensive solutions enable marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance. 41Table of ContentsOur hierarchy of solutions in the Digital Experience segment, available in our Adobe Experience Cloud, consists of the following cloud offerings:•Adobe Advertising Cloud—delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens.•Adobe Analytics Cloud—enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all Adobe clouds through the capture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating that data into singular customer profiles; includes Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager.•Adobe Marketing Cloud—provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys; includes Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”), Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target, Marketo Engage and Adobe Primetime.•Adobe Commerce Cloud—provides digital commerce, order management and predictive intelligence based on a unified commerce platform enabling shopping experiences across a wide array of industries. In addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital marketers, users of our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, digital marketers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers and marketing executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. We achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $820.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, representing 34% year-over-year growth. Driving the increase in Adobe Experience Cloud revenue was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $678.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 from $494.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, representing 37% year-over-year growth. Largely contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue was revenue associated with Marketo Engage. To a lesser extent, subscription revenue associated with our Adobe Commerce Cloud offerings and Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings AEM and Campaign also contributed to the overall increase. We expect that the addition of Marketo and continued demand across our portfolio of Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, including new offerings and enhancements to existing solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Other than the addition of revenue recognition to our critical accounting policies below, there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019, as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form\\xa010-K for the year ended November\\xa030, 2018. 42Table of ContentsRevenue Recognition Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services  are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design\\xa0or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.Cloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences, and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of PDFs across desktop, mobile, and web; automatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition, and automated document tagging.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition discussed above, and those included in our  Annual Report on Form 10-K, have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance or potential significance to us.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with the new revenue standard that was adopted under the modified retrospective method at the beginning of fiscal 2019. Prior period results have not been restated which limits the comparability of our results of operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 when compared to the year-ago period. See Note 1 of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further details about our recent adoption.Financial Performance Summary•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $7.86 billion as of August\\xa030, 2019 increased by $1.15 billion, or 17%, from $6.71 billion as of November\\xa030, 2018. The change in our Digital Media ARR is primarily due to stronger new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud offerings.•Creative revenue during the three months ended August\\xa030, 2019 of $1.65 billion increased by $294.7 million, or 22% compared to the year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings.•Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $820.9 million during the three months ended August\\xa030, 2019 increased by $206.9 million, or 34%, compared to the year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue driven by the addition of Marketo which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.•Our total deferred revenue of $3.26 billion as of August\\xa030, 2019 increased by $202.3 million, or 7%, from $3.05 billion as of November\\xa030, 2018 primarily due to increases in new contracts and the timing of renewals for offerings with cloud-enabled services and hosted services. Deferred revenue related to Marketo also contributed to the overall increase in our reported deferred revenue balance.•Cost of revenue of $416.0 million during the three months ended August\\xa030, 2019 increased by $120.5 million, or 41%, compared to the year-ago period primarily due to increases in amortization of purchased intangibles from our acquisition of Marketo. 43Table of Contents•Operating expenses of $1.56 billion during the three months ended August\\xa030, 2019 increased by $287.4 million, or 23%, compared to the year-ago period primarily due to increases in base compensation and related benefits costs and stock-based compensation expense associated with headcount growth, including additions from Marketo.•Net income of $792.8 million during the three months ended August\\xa030, 2019 increased by $126.5 million, or 19%, compared to the year-ago period primarily due to increases in revenue, offset in part by increases in operating expenses and cost of revenue.•Net cash flow from operations of $3.05 billion during the nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019 increased by $124.1 million, or 4%, compared to the year-ago period primarily due to higher net income, coupled with the net effect of non-cash items offset by decreases in income taxes payable and increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets.Revenue for the Three and Nine Months Ended August\\xa030, 2019 and August\\xa031, 2018(dollars in millions)Three Months\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Nine Months\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0% Change\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0% ChangeSubscription$2,546.6\\xa0$2,021.5\\xa026%\\xa0$7,307.7\\xa0$5,738.0\\xa027%Percentage of total revenue90%\\xa088%\\xa0\\xa0\\xa089%\\xa088%\\xa0\\xa0Product157.3\\xa0149.1\\xa05%\\xa0480.7\\xa0471.7\\xa02%Percentage of total revenue6%\\xa07%\\xa0\\xa0\\xa06%\\xa07%\\xa0\\xa0Services and support130.2\\xa0120.5\\xa08%\\xa0391.0\\xa0355.7\\xa010%Percentage of total revenue4%\\xa05%\\xa0\\xa0\\xa05%\\xa05%\\xa0\\xa0Total revenue$2,834.1\\xa0$2,291.1\\xa024%\\xa0$8,179.4\\xa0$6,565.4\\xa025%Subscription Revenue by SegmentOur subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings including Creative Cloud and certain of our Adobe Experience Cloud and Document Cloud services.

Sales and marketing expenses increased during the three and nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019 as compared to the three and nine months ended August\\xa031, 2018 due to the following:\\xa0%\\xa0Change2019-2018QTD\\xa0%\\xa0Change2019-2018YTDMarketing spend related to campaigns, events and overall marketing efforts7%\\xa010%Base compensation and related benefits associated with headcount7\\xa08Incentive compensation, cash and stock-based2\\xa05Professional and consulting fees2\\xa02Amortization of contract acquisition costs, including sales commissions1\\xa01Various individually insignificant items2\\xa03Total change21%\\xa029% 48Table of ContentsGeneral and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel.

Interest and other income (expense), net also includes realized gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains and losses recorded to deferred revenue and revenue from our hedging programs.Interest ExpenseInterest expense represents interest associated with our Term Loan, senior notes and interest rate swaps. Interest on our Term Loan is payable periodically at the end of each interest period, whereas interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments. See Notes 6 and 14 of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our senior notes and interest rate swaps. 49Table of ContentsInterest expense increased during the three and nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019 as compared to the three and nine months ended August\\xa031, 2018 primarily due to interest on our Term Loan which was entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.  Investment Gains (Losses), NetInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets which are classified as trading securities, and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies. Investment gains increased during the nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019 as compared to the nine months ended August\\xa031, 2018 primarily due to the gain recognized upon our acquisition of the remaining interest in Allegorithmic in January 2019, which was accounted for as an equity-method investment immediately before the acquisition. See Note 3 of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our acquisition of Allegorithmic.Provision for Income Taxes for the Three and Nine Months Ended August\\xa030, 2019 and August\\xa031, 2018(dollars in millions)Three Months\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Nine Months\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0% Change\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0% ChangeProvision$41.7\\xa0$35.1\\xa019%\\xa0$148.0\\xa0$182.1\\xa0(19)%Percentage of total revenue1%\\xa02%\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02%\\xa03%\\xa0\\xa0Effective tax rate5%\\xa05%\\xa0\\xa0\\xa07%\\xa09%\\xa0\\xa0Our effective tax rate is the same for the three months ended August\\xa030, 2019, as compared to the three months ended August\\xa031, 2018. The effective tax rate for the three months ended August 30, 2019 included U.S. federal and state taxes associated with our current year international earnings resulting from the international provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") effective in fiscal 2019. This increase was substantially equivalent to the provisional accounting expenses recorded in the prior year for the effects of the Tax Act adoption.Our effective tax rate decreased by two percentage points for the nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019, as compared to the nine months ended August\\xa031, 2018. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended August\\xa031, 2018 included provisional accounting expenses for the effects of the Tax Act adoption which was slightly more than the impact resulting from the international provisions of the Tax Act effective in fiscal 2019.The Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017 lowered the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective on January 1, 2018. Beginning in our fiscal 2019, the annual statutory federal corporate tax rate is 21% and certain international provisions of the Tax Act, such as a tax on global intangible low-tax income, a base erosion and anti-abuse tax, and a special tax deduction for foreign-derived intangible income, took effect. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed regulations that could impact the calculation of taxes related to these provisions and which are anticipated to be applicable on a retroactive basis. While the Company continues to evaluate the impact, such regulations have not been finalized and are subject to change. We will account for new regulations in the period of enactment.We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. On the basis of this evaluation, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance related primarily to the realizability of state and foreign credits of $206.9 million as of the period ended August\\xa030, 2019. We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. The Tax Act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017, including certain earnings that were not subject to the one-time transition or global intangible low-tax income tax. As we repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings for use in the U.S., the distributions will generally not be subject to further U.S. federal tax.Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $170.6 million and $231.3 million as of August\\xa030, 2019 and August\\xa031, 2018, respectively. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at August\\xa030, 2019 and August\\xa031, 2018 were recognized in the future, $112.4 million and $186.0 million would decrease the respective effective tax rates. 50Table of ContentsThe combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $23.2 million and $23.1 million for the three months ended August\\xa030, 2019 and August\\xa031, 2018, respectively. These amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and long-term assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $20.0 million.In addition, in the United States, the European Commission, countries in the European Union and other countries where we do business, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries and other governmental bodies have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. Moreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThis data should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\\xa0As of(in millions)August\\xa030, 2019\\xa0November\\xa030, 2018Cash and cash equivalents$2,209.0\\xa0$1,642.8Short-term investments$1,441.7\\xa0$1,586.2Working capital$(2,052.9)\\xa0$555.9Stockholders’ equity$10,242.8\\xa0$9,362.1Working CapitalWorking capital as of August\\xa030, 2019 and November\\xa030, 2018 was $2.05 billion of a deficit and $555.9 million of a surplus, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the reclassification of $3.15 billion total carrying value of our $2.25 billion term loan due April 30, 2020 (“Term Loan”) and $900 million 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (“2020 Notes”) to current liabilities. We intend to refinance our Term Loan and 2020 Notes on or before the due dates.A summary of our cash flows is as follows:\\xa0Nine Months Ended(in millions)August\\xa030, 2019\\xa0August\\xa031, 2018Net cash provided by operating activities$3,045.4\\xa0$2,921.3Net cash used for investing activities(287.1)\\xa0(1,546.4)Net cash used for financing activities(2,180.4)\\xa0(1,930.3)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(11.6)\\xa0(3.5)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$566.3\\xa0$(558.9)\\xa0Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. The primary uses of cash are our stock repurchase program as described below, payroll-related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other uses of cash include business acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards. 51Table of ContentsCash Flows from Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities of $3.05 billion for the nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019 was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with an increase in deferred revenue, which was offset in large part by cash outflows due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily driven by increases related to Digital Media offerings with cloud-enabled services, and Digital Experience hosted services and Marketo offerings. The primary working capital use of cash was due to increases in prepaid expenses driven by the timing of billings and payments associated with certain vendors, sales commissions paid and capitalized, advanced payments related to income taxes and prepaid payroll related to employee benefits.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesNet cash used for investing activities of $287.1 million for the nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019 was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment and our acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Allegorithmic. These cash outflows were offset primarily by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. See Note 3 of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our acquisition of Allegorithmic.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesNet cash used for financing activities of $2.18 billion for the nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019 was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, which were offset by proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock for our employee stock purchase plan. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. Other Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2019 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct costs and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in Part II, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors”. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.We have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries through October 17, 2023. As of August\\xa030, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. As of August\\xa030, 2019, we have a $2.25 billion Term Loan outstanding due April 30, 2020 and $1.90 billion senior notes outstanding, consisting of the 2020 Notes and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February\\xa01, 2025 (“2025 Notes,” and together with the 2020 Notes, “Notes”). The Notes and Term Loan rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we reclassified the 2020 Notes as current debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of August\\xa030, 2019, the carrying value of the 2020 Notes was $898.9 million which includes the fair value of the related interest rate swap and is net of debt issuance costs. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we reclassified the Term Loan with a  carrying value of $2.25 billion, net of unamortized original issuance discount, as current debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We intend to refinance the Term Loan and 2020 Notes on or before the due dates.During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our Term Loan and 2020 Notes, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon debt issuance.Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, US agency securities, municipal securities, US Treasury securities and foreign government securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.  52Table of ContentsStock Repurchase ProgramTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In May 2018, our Board of Directors granted us an authority to repurchase up to $8 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2021.During the nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019 and August\\xa031, 2018, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $2 billion and $1.75 billion, respectively. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During the nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019, we repurchased approximately 7.1 million shares at an average price of $266.96 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2018 and the nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019. During the nine months ended August\\xa031, 2018 we repurchased approximately 7.1 million shares at an average price of $225.15 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2017 and the nine months ended August\\xa031, 2018.For the nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our condensed consolidated balance sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by August\\xa030, 2019 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of August\\xa030, 2019, $250.1 million of prepayment remained under this agreement.Subsequent to August\\xa030, 2019, as part of the May 2018 stock repurchase authority, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $750 million. Upon completion of the $750 million stock repurchase agreement, $5.1 billion remains under our May 2018 authority. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments as of August\\xa030, 2019 consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. Except as discussed below, there have been no other material changes in those obligations during the nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019. See Notes 13 and 14 of our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our contractual commitments. Purchase ObligationsDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we amended two existing vendor agreements that include an aggregated incremental minimum purchase commitment of $1.74 billion through May 2024. There were no other significant changes in our purchase obligations during the nine months ended August\\xa030, 2019. Transition Taxes LiabilityAs a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, an accrued transition tax liability of approximately $427.1 million is payable in installments through fiscal 2026.\\xa0The Tax Act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017, including certain earnings that were not subject to the one-time transition or global intangible low-tax income tax. As we repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings for use in the U.S., the distributions will generally not be subject to further U.S. federal tax.\\xa0 Term LoanAs of August\\xa030, 2019, our Term Loan’s carrying value was $2.25 billion. At our election, the Term Loan will bear interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500% to 1.000% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040% to 0.110%. Interest is payable periodically, in arrears, at the end of each interest period we elect. Based on the LIBOR rate at August\\xa030, 2019, our estimated maximum commitment for interest payments was $37.7 million for the remaining duration of the Term Loan. 53Table of ContentsSenior NotesAs of August\\xa030, 2019, the carrying value of our Notes payable was $1.89 billion. Interest on our Notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At August\\xa030, 2019, our maximum commitment for interest payments was $200.1 million for the remaining duration of our Notes.CovenantsOur Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement contain similar financial covenants requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of August\\xa030, 2019, we were in compliance with this covenant. We believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants.Under the terms of our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesSee Results of Operations, Provision for Income Taxes above for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.RoyaltiesWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold or a percentage of the underlying revenue.IndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
