MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted) The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included herein for Amphenol Corporation (\\\"Amphenol\\\", the \\\"Company\\\", \\\"we\\\", \\\"our\\\", or \\\"us\\\"), which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\\"U.S. GAAP\\\"). The following discussion and analysis also includes references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined in the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section below, including \\\"Constant Currency Net Sales Growth\\\" and \\\"Organic Net Sales Growth\\\". For purposes of the following discussion, the terms \\\"constant currencies\\\" and \\\"organically\\\" have the same meaning as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" within this Item 2 for more information, including our reasons for including the non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures. Safe Harbor Statement This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which relate to future, not past, events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements, which address the Company's expected business and financial performance and financial condition, among other matters, may contain words such as: \\\"anticipate,\\\" \\\"could,\\\" \\\"continue,\\\" \\\"expect,\\\" \\\"estimate,\\\" \\\"forecast,\\\" \\\"ongoing,\\\" \\\"project,\\\" \\\"seek,\\\" \\\"predict,\\\" \\\"target,\\\" \\\"will,\\\" \\\"intend,\\\" \\\"plan,\\\" \\\"optimistic,\\\" \\\"potential,\\\" \\\"guidance,\\\" \\\"may,\\\" \\\"should,\\\" or \\\"would\\\" and other words and terms of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about expected earnings, revenues, growth, liquidity or other financial matters. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements, including those with regards to results of operations, liquidity or the Company's effective tax rate and the related impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\\\"Tax Act\\\"), are based upon reasonable assumptions, the expectations may not be attained or there may be material deviation. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following: the Company's dependence on sales to the communications industry, which markets are dominated by large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on suppliers such as the Company; the Company's dependence on sales to the military market, including the impact of reductions or changes in the defense budgets of U.S. and foreign governments; the Company's ability to compete successfully on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time; the Company's ability to continue to conceive, design, source and market new products, as well as market acceptance of the Company's existing and future product lines, for continued revenue growth; the Company's ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, including as a result of significant deterioration of general economic or capital market conditions, or as a result of a downgrade in the Company's credit rating; changes in exchange rates of the various currencies in which the Company conducts business, including possible currency devaluations; changes in interest rates which could impact existing or future issuances of debt; changes in tax laws, regulations and guidance, including related interpretations, in the United States and international jurisdictions, such as the Tax Act; political, economic, military and other risks in countries outside of the United States, including political, economic, financial or other instability, intergovernmental conflicts or actions, strikes or natural disasters; the impact of general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions and U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including those affecting China, on the Company's business operations; difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses as part of the Company's growth strategy, including the potential for the impairment of goodwill; the Company's ability to obtain a consistent supply of materials, at stable pricing levels, used in the Company's manufacturing processes, including aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, certain rare 21 Table of Contents earth metals and plastic resins; litigation or environmental matters including changes to laws and regulations that the Company may be subject to; and cybersecurity threats or incidents that could arise. Such forward-looking statements may also be impacted by, among other things, clarifications to and additional guidance under the Tax Act. More specifically, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted and it significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The provisional income tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 incorporated assumptions made based on the Company's current interpretation of the Tax Act and information then available. The Company continues to obtain, prepare and fully analyze all of the necessary information in order to complete its accounting of the Tax Act, which may require adjustments in 2018 related to this charge. A further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the Company's other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These or other uncertainties may cause the Company's actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in any forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 On December 22, 2017, the United States federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\\\"Tax Act\\\"), marking a change from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system in the United States. As part of this change, the Tax Act, among other changes, provides for a transition tax on the accumulated unremitted foreign earnings and profits of the Company's foreign subsidiaries (\\\"Transition Tax\\\") and a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an income tax charge of $398.5 (\\\"Tax Act Charge\\\") that was comprised of (i) the Transition Tax of $259.4, (ii) a charge of $176.6 related to changes in the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by (iii) a tax benefit of $37.5 associated with the remeasurement of the Company's U.S. net deferred tax liabilities due to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction. The three components of the Tax Act Charge are provisional amounts recorded in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\\\"SAB 118\\\") (now codified in ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118). SAB 118 addresses the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the Tax Act's enactment and the complexity of its provisions, the Company has not completed its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act. The Company continues to analyze guidance and technical interpretations of the provisions of the Tax Act, as well as refine, analyze and update the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare the Tax Act Charge. In accordance with ASU 2018-05, the Company will complete its accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act within the one-year measurement period in 2018, once the Company has obtained, prepared and fully analyzed all the necessary information related to all three components of the Tax Act Charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company did not make any adjustments to the Tax Act Charge during the first quarter of 2018. Results of Operations Three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 Net sales were $1,866.9 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1,560.1 in the first quarter of 2017, which represented an increase of 20% in U.S. dollars, 16% in constant currencies and 12% organically over the same prior year quarter. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2018 increased 21% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 13% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The sales growth was driven by increases in the mobile devices, industrial, automotive, military, and commercial aerospace markets, arising primarily from organic growth along with contributions from the Company's acquisitions. Net sales in both the mobile networks and information technology and data communications markets were relatively flat in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Net sales in the first quarter of 2018 in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband 22 Table of Contents market, were flat in U.S. dollars while decreasing 1% in constant currencies and 1% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017: Percentage Growth (relative to same prior year period) Net sales Foreign Constant Organic growth in currency Currency Net Acquisition Net Sales U.S. Dollars (1) impact (2) Sales Growth (3) impact (4) Growth (3) Three Months Ended March 31: 2018 2017 (GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) Net sales: Interconnect Products and Assemblies $ 1,770.0 $ 1,463.5 21 % 4 % 17 % 4 % 13 % Cable Products and Solutions 96.9 96.6 - % 1 % (1) % - % (1) % Consolidated $ 1,866.9 $ 1,560.1 20 % 4 % 16 % 4 % 12 % (1) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 5 of the accompanying financial statements. (2) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year period(s) compared to the same period(s) in the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior periods from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior period net sales. (3) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section. (4) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company's results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Geographically, sales in the United States in the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately 15% in U.S. dollars ($527.0 in 2018 versus $457.9 in 2017) and 9% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017. International sales in the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately 22% in U.S. dollars ($1,339.9 in 2018 versus $1,102.2 in 2017), 16% in constant currencies and 13% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar for the first quarter of 2018 had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $63.4 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $230.0 or 12.3% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $201.8 or 12.9% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. Administrative expenses represented approximately 5.0% of net sales for both the first quarter of 2018 and 2017. Research and development expenses represented approximately 2.8% of net sales for both the first quarter of 2018 and 2017. Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.5% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018 and represented approximately 5.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. Operating income was $376.9 or 20.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $314.1 or 20.1% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the first quarter of 2018 was $391.1 or 22.1% of net sales compared to $323.9 or 22.1% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the first quarter of 2018 was $11.3 or 11.7% of net sales compared to $13.7 or 14.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the first quarter of 2018, compared to the first quarter of 2017, was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs. Interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $24.5 compared to $19.3 for the first quarter of 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates associated with the Company's commercial paper borrowings as well as the senior note issuances in April 2017, along with higher average debt levels used to fund the Company's dividend and stock buyback programs. Provision for income taxes for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 were at an effective tax rate of 24.4% and 23.8%, respectively. For the first quarter of 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 110 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.01. 23 Table of Contents For the first quarter of 2017, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 270 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.02. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section below, for the first three months of 2018 and 2017 was 25.5% and 26.5%, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. Refer to Note 14 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to income taxes. Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (\\\"Diluted EPS\\\") were $265.6 and $0.84, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $224.9 and $0.71, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the effect of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section below within this Item 2, were $261.5 and $0.83, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $216.9 and $0.69, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017. The following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017: Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net Income Net Income attributable Effective attributable Effective Operating Operating to Amphenol Tax Diluted Operating Operating to Amphenol Tax Diluted Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) EPS Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) EPS Reported (GAAP) $ 376.9 20.2 % $ 265.6 24.4 % $ 0.84 $ 314.1 20.1 % $ 224.9 23.8 % $ 0.71 Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation - - (4.1) 1.1 (0.01) - - (8.0) 2.7 (0.02) Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 376.9 20.2 % $ 261.5 25.5 % $ 0.83 $ 314.1 20.1 % $ 216.9 26.5 % $ 0.69 (1) While the terms \\\"operating margin\\\" and \\\"effective tax rate\\\" are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure. Liquidity and Capital Resources At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,024.3 and $1,753.7, respectively. The vast majority of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 is located outside of the United States. Historically, we have asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside of the United States. The Tax Act's change to a modified territorial tax system in the United States has significantly reduced the tax expense associated with the remittance of foreign earnings, among other changes. Therefore, the Company recorded a provisional charge for the foreign and U.S. state and local tax cost related to changes in the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to accumulated unremitted earnings prior to 2018 from certain foreign subsidiaries, due to our intention to repatriate such foreign earnings over time. Such taxes will be paid when those respective earnings are repatriated. As a result of this change, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company has repatriated a significant portion of its foreign cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company intends to continue to repatriate certain foreign earnings generated prior to 2018 throughout the remainder of 2018. The Company also intends to selectively distribute current year earnings for 2018 and beyond from its foreign subsidiaries and will accrue taxes, if any, on those earnings as appropriate. For current year earnings not distributed, the Company intends to treat such earnings as permanently reinvested outside of the United States. The Tax Act also resulted in a Transition Tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, which we will pay, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in annual installments until 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. The Company does not believe that these future tax payments will have a significant impact on its liquidity or capital resources. 24 Table of Contents Cash Flow Summary The following table summarizes the Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, as reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow: Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 130.2 $ 237.8 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (142.3) 8.9 Net cash used in financing activities (728.2) (53.7) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 21.4 15.3 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (718.9) $ 208.3 Operating Activities The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company's fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $130.2 in the first three months of 2018 compared to $237.8 in the first three months of 2017. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities (\\\"operating cash flow\\\") for the first three months of 2018 compared to the first three months of 2017 is primarily related to the Company's voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fully fund its U.S. defined benefit pension plans (\\\"U.S. Plans\\\", and together with its foreign plans, the \\\"Plans\\\") as well as a slightly higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital, all of which was partially offset by an increase in net income in the first three months of 2018. In the first three months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $133.3, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $99.3 and $65.5, respectively, and an increase in inventories of $55.8, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $118.3. In the first three months of 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $66.8, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to a decrease in accrued expenses of $66.0 and increases in inventories and other current assets of $23.9 and $21.0, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $48.6. The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable decreased $82.8 to $1,515.8 primarily due to lower sales in the first quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, which were partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 (\\\"Translation\\\"). Days sales outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 74 and 73 days, respectively. Inventories increased $59.9 to $1,166.8, primarily to support expected future sales levels, as well as the effect of Translation. Inventory days at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were 84 and 76 days, respectively. Other current assets increased $33.4 to $230.2 primarily due to the recording of contract assets of $21.9 in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 as well as an increases in other receivables. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $22.5 to $839.3 primarily due to capital expenditures of $54.9 as well as Translation, partially offset by depreciation of $47.4. Goodwill increased $103.9 to $4,146.5 primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to an acquisition in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that closed in the first quarter of 2018, as well as Translation. Accounts payable decreased $77.4 to $798.2, primarily as a result of payments on outstanding payables, which more than offset purchasing activity. Payable days at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 57 and 60 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, decreased $66.1 to $636.6 primarily as a result of decreases in accrued wages and salaries and other employee-related compensation and benefits, partially offset by an increase in accrued income taxes. Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased $81.5 to $190.5 primarily due to the Company's voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in January 2018 to fully fund the Company's U.S. Plans. 25 Table of Contents The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations and including the first quarter contribution to its U.S. Plans, cash contributions to the Plans will aggregate approximately $90.0 in 2018. The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of the Plans' assets. In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company's ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. As described in more detail above, the decrease in Free Cash Flow is primarily related to the decrease in operating cash flow during the first three months of 2018 which is driven by the voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plans of approximately $81.0 as discussed above, along with an increase in capital expenditures. Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 130.2 $ 237.8 Capital expenditures (GAAP) (54.9) (48.7) Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) $ 75.3 $ 189.1 Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities was $142.3 in the first quarter of 2018, while net cash provided by investing activities was $8.9 in the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $99.5 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $54.1, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $11.3. In the first quarter of 2017, cash provided by investing activities was driven primarily by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $103.9, partially offset by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $48.4 and the funding of acquisitions of $46.6. Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company's credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests. Net cash used in financing activities was $728.2 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $53.7 in the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company's common stock of $382.0, net repayments of long-term debt of $304.8, dividend payments of $58.1 and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $3.9, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $20.6. For the first quarter of 2017, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company's common stock of $249.2, dividend payments of $49.3, and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $4.2, partially offset by increased net borrowings of $225.3 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $23.7. The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders' equity. The Company's debt financing includes the use of a commercial paper program, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy. The Company has a $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the \\\"Revolving Credit Facility\\\"), which matures March 2021 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company intends to utilize the Revolving 26 Table of Contents Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At March 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At March 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the commercial paper program, the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements (the \\\"Commercial Paper Program\\\"). The maximum aggregate principal amount of the commercial paper notes that may be outstanding at any time under the Commercial Paper Program is $2,000.0. Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program are borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The Commercial Paper Program is rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's and P-2 by Moody's and is backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility. The amount of commercial paper notes outstanding as of March 31, 2018 was $869.6. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future. As of March 31, 2018, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the \\\"Senior Notes\\\") as follows: Principal Interest Amount Rate Maturity $ 750.0 2.55 % January 2019 400.0 2.20 % April 2020 375.0 3.125 % September 2021 500.0 4.00 % February 2022 350.0 3.20 % April 2024 The Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company's other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions. The 2.55% Senior Notes are due in January 2019 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2018. Refer to Note 13 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company's debt. On January 24, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company's Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the \\\"2017 Stock Repurchase Program\\\"). During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its common stock for $382.0. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had repurchased approximately 12.6 million shares for $1,000.0 under the previously announced $1,000.0 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. On April 24, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company's Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the \\\"2018 Stock Repurchase Program\\\"). As of April 30, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock for $55.5 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price. 27 Table of Contents Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock. The following table summarizes the declared quarterly dividends per share as well as the dividends declared and paid for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017: Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Dividends declared per share $ 0.19 $ 0.16 Dividends declared $ 57.4 $ 48.9 Dividends paid (including those declared in the prior year) 58.1 49.3 On April 24, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.19 to $0.23 per share effective with dividends declared in the second quarter of 2018. Liquidity and Cash Requirements The Company's primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Commercial Paper Program, the Revolving Credit Facility, and its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the recent issuances of both the 2020 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes in April 2017) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future, including the repayment of the $750.0 outstanding principal amount of 2.55% Senior Notes due January 2019 (the \\\"2.55% Notes\\\"). The Company's primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends, debt service (including the repayment of the 2.55% Notes), and payments associated with the Transition Tax which is payable in annual installments until 2025 and taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings. The Company's debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Program. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. Environmental Matters Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to assessing the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company's financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company's Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company's overall financial performance, trends and period-over-period comparative results, in addition to the reasons noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures related to operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, effective tax rate and diluted EPS exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. Items excluded in such non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs, and certain discrete tax items including but not limited to (i) the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (ii) the Tax Act Charge recorded in 2017 and any subsequent adjustments recorded in 2018 related to this charge. Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact related to foreign currency exchange and acquisitions. 28 Table of Contents The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items. The non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in \\\"Results of Operations\\\" and \\\"Liquidity and Capital Resources\\\" within this Item 2: \\u00b7 Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects, that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined below, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. \\u00b7 Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as Provision for income taxes, as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, expressed as a percentage of Income before income taxes, as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, each excluding the income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. \\u00b7 Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation is defined as Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. \\u00b7 Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating income, as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. \\u00b7 Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income). \\u00b7 Constant Currency Net Sales Growth is defined as the period-over-period percentage change in net sales growth, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Amphenol's results are subject to volatility related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. As such, management evaluates the Company's sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Organic Net Sales Growth (defined below) and Constant Currency Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends. \\u00b7 Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities (\\\"operating cash flow\\\" - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), both of which are derived from the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to shareholders through either stock repurchases or dividends. \\u00b7 Organic Net Sales Growth is defined as the period-over-period percentage change in net sales growth resulting from operating volume and pricing changes, and excludes the impact of 1) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which directly impact the Company's operating results and are outside the control of the Company and 2) acquisitions closed during the periods presented, which were not included in the Company's results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Management evaluates the Company's sales performance based on actual sales growth 29 Table of Contents in U.S. dollars, as well as Constant Currency Net Sales Growth (defined above) and Organic Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company's disclosures of its critical accounting policies, which are contained in its 2017 Annual Report, have not materially changed since that report was filed. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company's policies related to revenue recognition have been updated in accordance with Note 3 of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\",\n          \"Item 2.

This is followed by a discussion of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then discuss our Results of Operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discuss our financial commitments in the section titled \\\"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\\\" Business and Macroeconomic EnvironmentIn the first half of calendar 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic initially resulted in a global disruption in economic activity by adversely affecting production, creating supply chain and market disruption, and adversely impacting businesses and individuals. However, in the second half of fiscal 2021, business conditions were unexpectedly strong as businesses and individuals adapted to the effects of the pandemic. In response to global supply constraints, we worked to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business by qualifying alternative suppliers, increasing our inventory of raw materials, ramping our internal factories and adding assembly and test capacity to increase our manufacturing capability while securing additional capacity with our subcontractors wherever possible. Strong customer demand for our products continued to outpace capacity in the first half of fiscal 2023 and in fiscal 2022. While our business remained strong in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, our overall business in China, which is one of our key markets, was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 lock-downs and the subsequent rapid transmission of COVID-19 when lock-downs in China were lifted. In addition, rising interest rates and high inflation in the U.S. may result in a slowdown in the global economy and reduce customer demand in our industry. We are unable to predict the timing or impact of any such slowdown on our business. Despite supply gradually improving in recent quarters, and more improvement expected in the coming quarters, we expect that certain supply chain constraints will persist through much of calendar 2023; however, recent uncertainty in the U.S. and world economies may lessen the impact of such constraints on our business in future periods. In order to provide prioritized capacity to our customers, we launched our Preferred Supply Program in February 2021, which provides our customers with prioritized capacity beginning six months after the customer places an order for 12 months of continuous, non-cancellable and non-reschedulable backlog. Since the first quarter of calendar 2022, we have been entering into certain long-term supply agreements with our customers for products that will be shipped in future periods. We also entered into certain long-term supply agreements with key suppliers. In response to the pandemic, we have taken proactive preventative measures to enable a safe environment for our employees and operation of our manufacturing sites. While our global manufacturing sites have been fully operational in recent periods, we strategically implemented plans intended to provide more assurance of business continuity in the event severe outbreaks or government requirements were to impact our operations.Strategy We develop, manufacture and sell smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions used by our customers for a wide variety of applications. Our strategic focus includes general purpose and specialized 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers, microprocessors, analog, FPGA, and memory products. With over 30 years of technology leadership, our broad product portfolio is a Total System Solution (TSS) for our customers that can provide a large portion of the silicon requirements in their applications. TSS is a combination of hardware, software and services which help our customers increase their revenue, reduce their costs and manage their risks compared to other solutions. Our synergistic product portfolio empowers disruptive growth trends, including 5G, data centers, sustainability, Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving, and electric vehicles, in key end markets such as automotive, aerospace and defense, communications, consumer appliances, data centers and computing, and industrial.26Table of ContentsOur manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication, wafer probe, assembly and test. The ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control, resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry. By owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical techniques (statistical process control, designed experiments and wafer level monitoring), we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields. Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles. This control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing profit margin. We outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing has increased in recent years due to our acquisitions of Microsemi and other companies that outsourced all or substantial portions of their manufacturing. Although we recently considered building a 300 mm U.S. based wafer fabrication facility for specialized, trailing edge process technologies, we have concluded that our business objectives could likely be better achieved through relationships with our foundry suppliers.We employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products. We believe our processes afford us both cost-effective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs. While many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines, we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and non-volatile memory products. This allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly. Our engineers utilize advanced computer-aided design tools and software to perform circuit design, simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently. We are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including development systems, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies. We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position. Our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers, digital signal controllers, memory, analog and mixed-signal products, FPGAs, timing systems, Flash-IP, development systems, software and application-specific software libraries. We are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products. We market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors. Our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia. We currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets. We believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market. Many of our CEMs, ESEs, and sales managers have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments. We believe that the technical and business knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products. The primary mission of our ESE team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team. ESEs also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world or through online webcasts. Our licensing division has dedicated sales, technology, design, product, test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees. See the risk factor captioned \\\"Our operating results are impacted by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the industry\\\" on page 43 for discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Except for the changes discussed in \\\"Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\\" in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, there were no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the first nine months of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 compared to our \\\"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\\" as previously described in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. 27Table of ContentsResults of Operations The following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the periods covered by this report:Three Months Ended December 31,Nine Months Ended December 31,2022202120222021Net sales100.0 %100.0 %100.0 %100.0 %Cost of sales32.2 34.4 32.7 35.1 Gross profit67.8 65.6 67.3 64.9 Research and development13.0 14.0 13.2 14.7 Selling, general and administrative9.4 10.1 9.6 10.7 Amortization of acquired intangible assets7.7 12.2 8.1 13.0 Special charges (income) and other, net0.3 - (0.1)0.4 Operating income37.4 %29.3 %36.5 %26.1 %Net Sales We operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design, development, manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our SuperFlash and other technologies. We sell our products to distributors and OEMs in a broad range of markets, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral. In certain circumstances, a customer's financial condition may require collateral, and, in such cases, the collateral would be typically provided in the form of letters of credit.The following table summarizes our net sales for the periods covered by this report (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 31,Nine Months Ended December 31,20222021Change20222021ChangeNet sales$2,169.2 $1,757.5 23.4 %$6,206.0 $4,976.7 24.7 %The increases in net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 were primarily due to strong business conditions that began in the second half of fiscal 2021 as businesses and individuals adapted to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Business conditions continued to be strong in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 although there is increased uncertainty as to the future direction of the global economy due to rising interest rates and high inflation. Additionally, semiconductor industry conditions have resulted in increased costs throughout our supply chain, which we have been passing on to our customers in the form of price increases. Our price increases were implemented at various times and in various amounts throughout fiscal 2022 with respect to our very broad range of customers and products. These price increases also contributed to the increase in net sales during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. Due to the complexity of the implementation of the price increases and the changes in product, geographic and customer mix, we are not able to quantify the impact of the price increases on our net sales. Additionally, the increase in net sales was positively impacted by strength in all of our product lines. See our \\\"Business and Macroeconomic Environment\\\" discussion above for further information on our business outlook. Other factors that we believe contributed to changes in our reported net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 and which are drivers of long-term trends in our net sales but which factors we are not able to quantify include:semiconductor industry conditions;our various new product offerings that have increased our served available market;customers' increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions; andincreasing semiconductor content in our customers' products through our Total Systems Solutions.We sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any single product or customer that accounted for a material portion of the change in our net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 or the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. 28Table of ContentsNet sales by product line for the periods covered by this report were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 31,Nine Months Ended December 31,2022%2021%2022%2021%Microcontrollers$1,221.3 56.3 $972.2 55.3 $3,463.8 55.9 $2,768.7 55.6 Analog606.5 28.0 500.5 28.5 1,759.0 28.3 1,423.5 28.6 Other341.4 15.7 284.8 16.2 983.2 15.8 784.5 15.8 Total net sales$2,169.2 100.0 $1,757.5 100.0 $6,206.0 100.0 $4,976.7 100.0 Microcontrollers Our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales. Microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 56.3% and 55.9% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately 55.3% and 55.6% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Net sales of our microcontroller products increased 25.6% and 25.1% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. These sales increases were due primarily to strength in demand for our microcontroller products in end markets that we serve and our price increases. Historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product. However, the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have increased in recent periods and have remained relatively stable over time due to the proprietary nature of these products. We have in the past been able to, and expect in the future to be able to, moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices. Analog Our analog product line includes analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products. Our analog product line accounted for approximately 28.0% and 28.3% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately 28.5% and 28.6% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.Net sales from our analog product line increased 21.2% and 23.6% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to strength in demand for our analog products in end markets that we serve and our price increases. We consider a majority of the products in our analog product line to be proprietary in nature, where prices are relatively stable, similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products. The non-proprietary portion of our analog product line will experience price fluctuations, driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products. Other Our other product line includes FPGA products, royalties associated with licenses for the use of our SuperFlash and other technologies, sales of our intellectual property, fees for engineering services, memory products, timing systems, manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting), legacy application specific integrated circuits, and certain products for aerospace applications. Revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 15.7% and 15.8% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately 16.2% and 15.8% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Net sales related to these services and products increased 19.9% and 25.3% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increases in net sales were primarily due to strength in demand for our products in end markets that we serve and our price increases. Net sales of our other product line can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our FPGA products, licenses, engineering services, memory products, timing systems, and manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting). 29Table of ContentsDistribution Distributors accounted for approximately 48% and 47% of our net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and approximately 45% and 48% of our net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The lower distribution percentages in the second half fiscal 2022 and the first half of fiscal 2023 were due to lower Preferred Supply Program participation among our distributors. With the exception of Arrow Electronics, our largest distributor, which made up 10% of our net sales, no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in the nine months ended December 31, 2022. In the nine months ended December 31, 2021, no distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales. Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers. We believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base. We believe that customers recognize Microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel.Generally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice, with the exception of orders placed under our Preferred Supply Program or otherwise designated as non-cancellable. The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns. At December 31, 2022, our distributors maintained 22 days of inventory of our products compared to 17 days at March 31, 2022. Over the past ten fiscal years, the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 17 days and 40 days. Inventory holding patterns at our distributors may have a material impact on our net sales. Sales by Geography Sales by geography for the periods covered by this report were as follows (dollars in millions):Three Months Ended December 31,Nine Months Ended December 31,2022%2021%2022%2021%Americas$567.4 26.2 $439.3 25.0 $1,588.7 25.6 $1,232.2 24.8 Europe428.6 19.8 360.4 20.5 1,242.0 20.0 994.7 20.0 Asia1,173.2 54.0 957.8 54.5 3,375.3 54.4 2,749.8 55.2 Total net sales$2,169.2 100.0 $1,757.5 100.0 $6,206.0 100.0 $4,976.7 100.0 Americas sales include sales to customers in the U.S., Canada, Central America and South America. Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 77% of our total net sales in each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to approximately 78% of our total net sales in each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. Substantially all of our foreign sales are U.S. dollar denominated. Our sales force in the Americas and Europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to Asia. Gross Profit Our gross profit in the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $1.47 billion, or 67.8% of net sales, compared to $1.15 billion, or 65.6% of net sales, in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Our gross profit in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $4.18 billion, or 67.3% of net sales, compared to $3.23 billion, or 64.9% of net sales, in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin increased in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of higher utilization of our factories due to increased customer demand.Our overall inventory levels were $1.17 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $854.4 million at March 31, 2022. We maintained 152 days of inventory on our balance sheet at December 31, 2022 compared to 125 days of inventory at March 31, 2022. Inventory increased primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Our inventory levels are impacted by the timing of receipt of raw materials, foundry wafers, and strategic last time buy materials and completion of finished goods. We expect our days of inventory levels at March 31, 2023 to be 157 to 164 days. We operate assembly and test facilities in Thailand, the Philippines, and other locations throughout the world. Approximately 59% of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assembly facilities during each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Approximately 68% and 67% of our test requirements 30Table of Contentswere performed in our internal test facilities during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately 63% and 64% during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The percentage of our assembly and test operations that are performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry, our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities. We believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to third party contractor assembly and test costs, as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process. We plan to continue to invest in assembly and test equipment to increase our internal capacity capabilities and transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities.We rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements. Approximately 63% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries during each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 61% and 60% during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.Research and DevelopmentR&D expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $282.4 million, or 13.0% of net sales, compared to $245.4 million, or 14.0% of net sales, for the three months ended December 31, 2021. R&D expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $820.0 million, or 13.2% of net sales, compared to $730.0 million, or 14.7% of net sales, for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. We are committed to investing in new and enhanced products, including development systems software, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies. We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position. R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives. R&D expenses include labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for the development of process technologies, new packages, and software to support new products and design environments.R&D expenses increased $37.0 million, or 15.1%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 over the same period last year. R&D expenses increased $90.0 million, or 12.3%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 over the same period last year. The primary reasons for the increases in R&D costs were increases in headcount and employee compensation as well as higher product development costs. R&D expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.Selling, General and AdministrativeSelling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $202.9 million, or 9.4% of net sales, compared to $177.5 million, or 10.1% of net sales, for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $594.2 million, or 9.6% of net sales, compared to $531.7 million, or 10.7% of net sales, for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales, marketing and administrative personnel, advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses as well as costs related to our direct sales force, CEMs and ESEs who work remotely from sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $25.4 million, or 14.3%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 over the same period last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $62.5 million, or 11.8%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 over the same period last year. The primary reasons for the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were increases in headcount and employee compensation.Selling, general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.Amortization of Acquired Intangible AssetsAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $167.4 million and $502.5 million, respectively, compared to $215.7 million and $647.0 million for the three and nine months ended 31Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2021, respectively. The primary reason for the decreases in acquired intangible asset amortization was due to the use of accelerated amortization methods for assets placed in service in previous fiscal years.Special Charges (Income) and Other, Net During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred special charges and other, net of $6.5 million and earned special income and other, net of $6.1 million, respectively. The special charges and other, net incurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to restructuring of acquired and existing wafer fabrication operations to increase operational efficiency. The special income and other, net earned during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to a favorable resolution of a previously accrued legal matter partially offset by restructuring costs of acquired and existing wafer fabrication operations to increase operational efficiency. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, we earned special income and other, net of $0.3 million and incurred special charges and other, net of $20.4 million, respectively. The special income and other, net earned during the three months ended December 31, 2021, and the special charges and other, net incurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily related to restructuring of acquired and existing wafer fabrication operations to increase operational efficiency, legal contingencies and exiting non-manufacturing facilities including contract termination costs, employee severance, and the disposal of assets.Other Income (Expense)Interest income in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $0.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively, compared to $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021.Interest expense in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $52.8 million and $156.4 million, respectively, compared to $62.1 million and $199.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. The primary reasons for the decreases in interest expense relates to the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on April 1, 2022, which eliminated the amortization of debt discount on our Convertible Debt, and the cumulative pay down of our debt offset by higher interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt.During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized losses of $8.3 million related to the settlement of a portion of our outstanding 2015 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, and our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized losses of $16.1 million and $101.6 million, respectively, related to the settlement of a portion of our outstanding 2015 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, and our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt as well as the amendment and restatement of our Credit Agreement and the repayment of $1.00 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 3.922% 2021 Notes.Other income, net was $2.6 million and $3.5 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to $4.6 million and $3.5 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.Provision for Income TaxesOur provision for income taxes is attributable to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, increased significantly over the same period last year primarily due to a provision in the TCJA. Research and development expenditures incurred after March 31, 2022, must be capitalized and amortized ratably over five or fifteen years for tax purposes, depending on the location in which the research activities are conducted. The resulting capitalization of research and development expenditures impacts the calculation of our GILTI, which is treated as a period cost, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in which we have operations. The effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely, but they are generally lower than our combined U.S. federal and state effective tax rate. Our domestic blended statutory tax rate in each of the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was approximately 22%. Our non-U.S. blended statutory tax rates in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were lower than this amount. The difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors, including lower statutory rates, tax holidays, financing arrangements and other factors. Our effective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses.Our foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations and assets in Thailand, Malta, and Ireland. Our Thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in 32Table of Contentsproperty, plant, and equipment in Thailand. Our tax holiday periods in Thailand expire at various times in the future; however, we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays, otherwise we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20%. We do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in Thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate. The remaining material components of foreign income taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. are earnings accrued in Ireland at a 12.5% statutory tax rate and earnings accrued in Malta at a 5.0% statutory tax rate.In September 2021, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2012. The disputed amounts largely relate to transfer pricing matters. We firmly believe that the assessments are without merit and plan to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. In December 2021, we filed a petition in the United States Tax Court challenging the Notice. We intend to vigorously defend our position and we are confident in our ability to prevail on the merits. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations such as this to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves. We believe that the final adjudication of this matter will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows and that we have adequate tax reserves for all tax matters. However, the ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRS were to prevail on all of its assertions, the assessed tax, penalties, and deficiency interest could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Various taxing authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses. Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations. For U.S. federal, and in general for U.S. state tax returns, our fiscal 2007 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities. We are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. At this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be. We record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law. If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Inflation Reduction Act) into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (Corporate AMT) of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.00 billion over a three-year period. The Corporate AMT is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2024. We are evaluating the Corporate AMT and its potential impact on our future U.S. tax expense, cash taxes, and effective tax rate. 33Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources We had $288.9 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $30.5 million from the March 31, 2022 balance. Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.91 billion in the nine months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher net income of $1.63 billion, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $1.09 billion and net cash inflows of $190.3 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 include an increase in trade accounts receivable driven primarily by higher net sales and an increase in inventories related to increased raw materials, foundry wafers, finished goods, and receipt of strategic last time buy materials, offset by increases in accrued and other liabilities driven by higher sales related reserves, including cash collected from customers under our long-term supply agreements. The cash collected from these long-term supply agreements is refundable when customers fulfill their purchase commitments. In future periods, we expect cash inflows under these arrangements to decrease, and cash outflows to increase as amounts are refunded to customers (see \\\"Note 4. Net Sales\\\" to our condensed consolidated financial statements). Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.10 billion in the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to net income of $847.6 million, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $1.16 billion and net cash inflows of $91.6 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $448.7 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $335.0 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, net investing activities primarily related to capital purchases and investments in other assets. Our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions. Capital expenditures in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $373.5 million compared to $255.5 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment. We currently expect to invest between $400 million and $500 million in equipment and facilities during the next twelve months. We believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of our production requirements that are currently outsourced. We expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations. In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the CHIPS Act which is to provide billions of dollars of cash incentives and a new investment tax credit to increase domestic manufacturing capacity in our industry. Such incentives may potentially be available to us, our competitors and foundries; however, there can be no assurance that we will receive any such incentives, what the amount and timing of any incentive we receive will be, as to which other companies will receive incentives and whether the legislation will have a positive or negative impact on our competitive position. Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $2.49 billion in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1.73 billion in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows included:in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, $1.32 billion of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt, including our 2015 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt, and our Revolving Credit Facility, andin the first nine months of fiscal 2022, $1.17 billion of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt, including the cash portion of the settlement of our 2015 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt and our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt, our Revolving Credit Facility and our 3.922% 2021 Notes, partially funded by the issuance of our senior notes, andin the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we paid cash dividends to our stockholders of $499.4 million and $363.0 million, respectively, andin the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we repurchased shares of our common stock for $671.9 million and $166.0 million, respectively. In December 2021, we amended and restated our Credit Agreement in its entirety. The amended and restated Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility up to $2.75 billion that terminates on December 16, 2026. The 34Table of ContentsCredit Agreement also permits us, subject to certain conditions, to add one or more incremental term loan facilities or increase the revolving loan commitments up to $750.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was $6.62 billion. At December 31, 2022, we had $253.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility compared to $1.40 billion at March 31, 2022.Capital ReturnsIn November 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.00 billion of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we repurchased approximately 9.6 million shares of our common stock for $671.9 million under this authorization. In the first nine months of fiscal 2022, we repurchased approximately 2.0 million shares of our common stock for $166.0 million under this authorization. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $2.90 billion remained available for repurchases under the program. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 30.0 million shares as treasury shares. Our current intent is to regularly repurchase shares of our common stock over time based on our cash generation, leverage metrics, and market conditions.In October 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. To date, our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately $5.55 billion. A quarterly cash dividend of $0.328 per share was paid on December 6, 2022 in the aggregate amount of $180.3 million. A quarterly dividend of $0.358 per share was declared on February 2, 2023 and will be paid on March 7, 2023 to stockholders of record as of February 21, 2023. We expect the aggregate cash dividend for the March 2023 quarter to be approximately $196.0 million. Our Board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. Our current intent is to increase our quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions, our results of operations, and potential changes in tax laws.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from working capital requirements, interest and principal repayments related to our outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, cash dividends, share repurchases, and income tax payments. For additional information regarding our cash requirements see \\\"Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies\\\", \\\"Note 7. Debt\\\" and \\\"Note 12. Income Taxes\\\" to our condensed consolidated financial statements. The semiconductor industry is capital intensive and in order to remain competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development and to expand our existing facilities or potentially construct new facilities. We may increase our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes. The timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including our level of dividend payments, changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash, demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates. We may from time to time seek to refinance certain of our outstanding notes or Convertible Debt through issuances of new notes or convertible debt, tender offers, exchange transactions or open market repurchases. Such issuances, tender offers or exchanges or purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, our liquidity position and other factors. There can be no assurance that any financing will be available on acceptable terms due to uncertainties resulting from rising interest rates, higher inflation, economic uncertainty, the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders. We also plan to pursue incentives under the CHIPS Act to increase our domestic manufacturing capacity; however, there can be no assurance that we will receive any such incentives or what the amount and timing of any incentive we receive will be.\",\n          \"Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsBUSINESS OVERVIEWWe are a global premier systems provider of high technology products and services to the aerospace and defense industries. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms \\\"we,\\\" \\\"our,\\\" \\\"us,\\\" \\\"the Company,\\\" and \\\"RTX\\\" mean RTX Corporation and its subsidiaries. Raytheon follows a 4-4-5 fiscal calendar while Collins Aerospace (Collins) and Pratt & Whitney use a quarter calendar end. Throughout this Form 10-Q, when we refer to the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 with respect to Raytheon, we are referring to their September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 fiscal quarter ends, respectively. The current status of significant factors affecting our business environment in 2024 is discussed below. For additional discussion, refer to the \\\"Business Overview\\\" section in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Industry ConsiderationsOur worldwide operations can be affected by industrial, economic, and political factors on both a regional and global level. Our operations include original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and extensive related aftermarket parts and services related to our aerospace operations. Our defense business serves both domestic and international customers primarily as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for government customers. Our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycles in our commercial aerospace spares contracts and certain service contracts in our defense business, and longer cycles in our aerospace OEM and aftermarket maintenance contracts and on our defense contracts to design, develop, manufacture, or modify complex equipment. Our customers are in the public and private sectors, and our businesses reflect an extensive geographic diversification that has evolved with continued globalization. Government legislation, policies, and regulations can impact our business and operations. Changes in environmental and climate change-related laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, and energy taxes, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and facility upgrades and could increase our operational and environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes. In addition, government and industry-driven safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions, government imposed travel restrictions, and government procurement practices can impact our businesses.Collins and Pratt & Whitney serve both commercial and government aerospace customers. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs), available seat miles, and the general economic health of airline carriers and airframers are key barometers for our commercial aerospace operations. In particular, the ongoing work stoppages at a major airframer customer, may adversely impact our business. Performance in the general aviation sector is closely tied to the overall health of the economy and is positively correlated to corporate profits. Many of our aerospace customers are covered under long-term aftermarket service agreements at both Collins and Pratt & Whitney, which are inclusive of both spare parts and services.Our defense operations are affected by U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budget and spending levels, changes in demand, changes in policy positions or priorities, the domestic and global political and economic environment, and the evolving nature of the global and national security threat environment. In addition, our defense businesses engage in both direct commercial sales, which generally require U.S. government licenses and approvals, as well as foreign military sales, which are government-to-government transactions initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the U.S. government. Changes in these budget and spending levels, policies, or priorities, which are subject to U.S. domestic and foreign geopolitical risks and threats, may impact our defense businesses, including the timing of and delays in U.S. government licenses and approvals for sales, the risk of sanctions, or other restrictions. Refer to \\\"U.S. Government's Continuing Resolution\\\" below for additional information. Other MattersGlobal, economic, and political conditions, changes in raw material and commodity prices and supply, labor availability and costs, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical conflicts and strained intercountry relations, U.S. and non-U.S. tax law changes, foreign currency exchange rates, energy costs and supply, levels of air travel, the financial condition of commercial airlines, and the impact from natural disasters and weather conditions create uncertainties that could impact our businesses. Legal Matters. The Company has resolved several outstanding legal matters, herein referred to as \\\"Resolution of Certain Legal Matters.\\\" The Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Company settled an administrative proceeding with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), in connection with certain Middle East contracts since 2012 (Thales-Raytheon Systems and 32Table of ContentsRelated Matters). The Company also entered into a DPA and a False Claims Act (FCA) settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017 (DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes). In addition, the Company resolved certain voluntarily disclosed export controls violations primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser extent, Raytheon Company, including certain violations that were resolved pursuant to a consent agreement with the Department of State (DOS) (Trade Compliance Matters). As a result, we recorded a combined pre-tax charge of $918 million during the second quarter of 2024, which included an accrual of $269 million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes (in addition to amounts previously accrued), an accrual of $364 million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters (in addition to amounts previously accrued), and an accrual of $285 million related to Trade Compliance Matters. See \\\"Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies\\\" within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information.Pratt & Whitney Powder Metal Matter. As described further in \\\"Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies,\\\" within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, in 2023, Pratt & Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100G-JM (PW1100) Geared Turbofan (GTF) fleet, which powers the A320neo family of aircraft (A320neo) (herein referred to as the \\\"Powder Metal Matter\\\").Global Supply Chain. We are dependent on a global supply chain and in recent years have experienced supply chain disruptions that resulted in delays and increased costs which adversely affected our performance. These disruptions impacted our ability to procure raw materials, microelectronics, and certain commodities on a timely basis and/or at expected prices, and have been driven by supply chain market constraints and macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and labor market shortages. Current geopolitical conditions, including conflicts and other causes of strained intercountry relations, as well as sanctions and other trade restrictive activities, continue to contribute to these issues. Furthermore, our suppliers and subcontractors have been impacted by these same issues. As a result of the Canadian government's imposition of sanctions in February 2024, including those imposed on U.S.- and German-based Russian-owned entities from which we source titanium for use in our Canadian operations, we recorded charges of $175 million in the first quarter of 2024 within our Collins segment. These charges are primarily related to the recognition of unfavorable purchase commitments and an impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable as a result of initiating alternative titanium sources. We have implemented actions and programs to mitigate some of the impacts but anticipate supply chain disruptions to continue.Economic Environment. High inflation levels have increased material and component prices, labor rates, and supplier costs and have negatively impacted our operating profit and margin, including the impact on productivity expectations. Due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace businesses, and their respective customer and supplier contracts, we are not always able to offset cost increases by increasing our contract value or pricing, in particular on our fixed-price contracts. Increasing material, component, and labor prices could subject us to losses in our fixed price contracts in the event of cost overruns. In addition, higher interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and tightened the availability of capital. Among other things, these effects can constrain our customers' purchasing power and decrease orders for our products and services and impact the ability of our customers to make payments and of our suppliers to perform. Moreover, volatility in interest rates and financial markets can lead to economic uncertainty, an economic downturn or recession and impact the demand for our products and services as well as our supply chain. We continue to pursue strategic and operational initiatives to help address these macroeconomic pressures, including our digital transformation, operational modernization, cost reduction, and advanced technology programs, and we apply our Customer Oriented Results Excellence (CORE) operating platform to the execution of these initiatives. However, the impact of these pressures and corresponding initiatives is uncertain and subject to a range of factors and future developments.U.S. Government's Continuing Resolution. On September 26, 2024, President Biden signed a continuing resolution that funds federal agencies through December 20, 2024. A continuing resolution authorizes federal agencies to operate generally at the same funding levels from the prior year, but typically does not authorize new spending initiatives during this period. If Congress is unable to enact formal fiscal year 2025 appropriation bills by December 20, 2024, it may pass another continuing resolution. However, if Congress fails to pass the formal appropriations bills or a continuing resolution, then the U.S. government would shut down during which federal agencies would cease all non-essential functions.In the event of a U.S. government shutdown, our business, program performance and results of operations could be impacted by the resulting disruptions to federal government offices, workers, and operations, including risks relating to the funding of certain programs, stop work orders, as well as delays in contract awards, new program starts, payments for work performed, and other actions. We also may experience similar impacts in the event of an extended period of continuing resolutions. Generally, the significance of these impacts will primarily be based on the length of the continuing resolution or shutdown. Furthermore, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which imposes limits on discretionary spending for defense and non-defense programs in exchange for the lifting of the debt ceiling in June 2023, if Congress fails to enact appropriation bills by April 30, 33Table of Contents2025, then the budget caps will be reduced and corresponding automatic reductions to agency budget accounts will be enforced through sequestration.Geopolitical Matters. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company's management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software, and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers, including as discussed above in Global Supply Chain; however, based on information available to date, we do not currently expect these issues will have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We will continue to monitor future developments, including additional sanctions and other measures, that could adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers.In February 2023, China announced sanctions against Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD) (a former RTX Corporation (RTX) business segment which became part of Raytheon during the third quarter of 2023), and previously announced it may take measures against RTX, in connection with certain foreign military sales to Taiwan. The Chinese sanctions against RMD included a fine equal to twice the value of the arms that RMD sold to Taiwan since September 2020. In addition, in September 2022, China indicated that it decided to sanction our Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Gregory Hayes, in connection with another foreign military sale to Taiwan involving RTX products and services. In January 2024, China announced sanctions against Data Link Solutions LLC, a Collins joint venture and, most recently, in May 2024, China announced sanctions against Raytheon Missile Systems and the Javelin Joint Venture between Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. If China were to impose additional sanctions, enforce announced sanctions, or take other regulatory action against RTX, our suppliers, affiliates, or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. Any impact of these or other potential sanctions or other actions by China is uncertain.We have direct commercial sales contracts for products and services to certain foreign customers, for which U.S. government review and approval has been pending. The U.S. government's approval of these sales is subject to a range of factors, including its foreign policies related to these customers, which are subject to continuing review and potential changes. Likewise, regulatory approvals previously granted for prior sales can be paused or revoked if the products and services have not yet been delivered to the customer. In addition, certain programs require approvals by foreign governments, and those approvals may not be obtained on a timely basis or at all or may be revoked. If we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approvals, or those approvals are revoked, it could have a material effect on our financial results. In particular, during the third quarter of 2024, we received a critical license required to restart work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer. In order to perform under these contracts, significant actions are required, including obtaining additional regulatory approvals, and therefore we have not recognized revenue on these contracts to date. Should the remaining uncertainties be resolved, we do not expect these contracts to have a significant impact on our future financial results. As of September 30, 2024, our Contract liabilities include approximately $430 million of advance payments received in connection with these contracts, which may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated.We continue to closely monitor potential impacts from the war in Gaza and the recent escalation of conflict in the region on RTX's business, customers, suppliers, employees, and operations in Israel, the Middle East, and elsewhere. To date, the impacts to RTX have been minimal, though a number of countries have imposed restrictions on exports to or imports from Israel. RTX's commercial manufacturing facilities in Israel remain open and operational and have continued exporting products and importing critical items and raw materials. RTX's defense programs' ability to receive components from Israel has not been impacted in any material respect, though we could experience future delivery delays of certain products because of the current situation. Given the volatile nature of the situation, the potential impacts to RTX are subject to change.See Part I, Item 1A, \\\"Risk Factors\\\" in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these items.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. See \\\"Critical Accounting Estimates\\\" within Item 7 and \\\"Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles\\\" within Item 8 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual 34Table of Contentsresults in these areas could differ from management's estimates. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAs described in our \\\"Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results\\\" of this Form 10-Q, our interim period results of operations and period-to-period comparisons of our results, particularly at a segment level, may not be indicative of our future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods, including the discussion of segment results, should be viewed in this context.We provide the organic change in Net sales and Cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations as well as the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit for our segments. We believe that these non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. The organic change in Net sales, Cost of sales, and Operating profit excludes acquisitions and divestitures, net, and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations and other significant non-operational items and/or significant operational items that may occur at irregular intervals (Other). Additionally, the organic change in Cost of sales and Operating profit excludes restructuring costs, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, and costs related to certain acquisition accounting adjustments. Restructuring costs generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions and facility exit costs. We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), primarily related to our Raytheon segment. Acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable.Net Sales Quarter Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)2024202320242023Net sales$20,089 $13,464 $59,115 $48,993 The factors contributing to the change year-over-year in total net sales for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are as follows:(dollars in millions)Quarter Ended September 30, 2024Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024Organic (1)$1,555 $5,589 Acquisitions and divestitures, net(430)(862)Other5,500 5,395 Total change$6,625 $10,122 (1) See \\\"Results of Operations\\\" for definition of organic.

Additionally, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $138 million deferred tax benefit associated with legal entity reorganizations and a $56 million tax benefit in response to favorable U.S. Tax Court rulings issued to unrelated taxpayers, but with facts similar to ours. The nature of the tax item in the rulings is subject to a tax matters agreement entered into with Carrier and Otis in connection with the separation of those businesses in 2020, and therefore we recorded a pre-tax charge of $32 million for their respective indemnified amounts.The quarter ended September 30, 2024 also includes a $212 million tax charge related to U.S. federal income taxes now owed by the Company resulting from a favorable non-U.S. tax ruling Otis received in the quarter impacting pre-separation tax years. This tax ruling results in a reduction of U.S. foreign tax credits previously claimed by the Company in pre-separation tax years for which Otis must indemnify us. The Company currently expects to receive approximately $300 million from Otis in connection with the reduction to the foreign tax credits claimed and resulting indemnification obligation. The Company recorded a pre-tax benefit of $212 million representing a portion of the indemnity owed by Otis pursuant to the tax matters agreement and will record the remaining amount owed upon receipt. Additionally, the Company is indemnified for associated interest of $31 million as of September 30, 2024.In addition to items described above, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also includes a $275 million tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2024 resulting from the conclusion of the examination phases of the U.S. federal income tax audits for RTX 2017 and 2018 tax years and Rockwell Collins 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years, a $143 million tax cost associated with the sale of the CIS business, and the effective tax rate impact of the $918 million charge associated with the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters accrued during the second quarter of 2024 where no tax benefit has been recorded.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareowners Quarter Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)2024202320242023Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners$1,472 $(984)$3,292 $1,769 Diluted earnings (loss) per share$1.09 $(0.68)$2.45 $1.21 Net income attributable to common shareowners for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 includes the following:acquisition accounting adjustments of $0.4 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted earnings (loss) per share (EPS) of $0.31.Net loss attributable to common shareowners for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 includes the following:charge associated with the Powder Metal Matter of $2.2 billion, net of tax and partner share, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $1.53; andacquisition accounting adjustments of $0.4 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.28.Net income attributable to common shareowners for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes the following:acquisition accounting adjustments of $1.2 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.89;charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters of $0.9 billion, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.68;a charge of $0.4 billion, net of tax, related to the anticipated Raytheon Contract Termination, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.33;benefit recognized as a result of the conclusion of the examination phases of the RTX and Rockwell Collins tax audits of $0.3 billion, net of tax, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.21;a gain on sale of the CIS business, net of transaction and other related costs, of $0.2 billion, net of tax, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.18; andcharges related to initiating alternative titanium sources at our Collins segment of $0.2 billion, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.13. 41Table of ContentsNet income attributable to common shareowners for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes the following:charge associated with the Powder Metal Matter of $2.2 billion, net of tax and partner share, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $1.52;acquisition accounting adjustments of $1.2 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.80; andcharges on our contract assets and customer financing assets related to a customer insolvency of $0.1 billion, net of tax and noncontrolling interest, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.08.SEGMENT REVIEWOur operations, for the periods presented herein, are classified into three principal segments: Collins, Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon. Segments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operations, based on capabilities and technologies, where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products and services. Segment Total net sales and Operating profit include intercompany sales and profit, which are ultimately eliminated within Eliminations and other, which also includes certain smaller non-reportable segments. Segment results exclude certain acquisition accounting adjustments, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, and certain corporate expenses, as further discussed below. Given the nature of our business, we believe that total net sales and operating profit (loss) (and the related operating profit (loss) margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management's view of our segment performance, as described below.We provide the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments as discussed above in \\\"Results of Operations.\\\" We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. For Pratt & Whitney only, Other also includes the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at Pratt & Whitney Canada due to its significance to Pratt & Whitney's overall operating results.Total Net Sales.

See \\\"Note 1: Basis of Presentation\\\" within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information.Included in segment Operating profit (loss) are Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments, which relate to changes in Operating profit and margin due to revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion. These changes may reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance, as well as changes in facts and assumptions related to contract options, contract modifications, incentive and award fees associated with program performance, customer activity levels, and other customer-directed changes. For a full description of our EAC process, refer to \\\"Note 5: Changes in Contract Estimates at Completion\\\" within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Given that we have thousands of individual contracts, and given the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an on-going basis, and the nature of the work required to be performed under our contracts, we have both favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments in the ordinary course.We had the following aggregate EAC adjustments for the periods presented:Quarter Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)2024202320242023Gross favorable$260 $247 $803 $851 Gross unfavorable(351)(526)(1,118)(1,284)Total net EAC adjustments$(91)$(279)$(315)$(433)The change in net EAC adjustments of $0.2 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the absence of a $0.1 billion unfavorable impact recorded at Pratt & Whitney in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost to our aftermarket contracts resulting from the Powder Metal Matter.The change in net EAC adjustments of $0.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to favorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Pratt & Whitney, as discussed above, and Raytheon, partially offset by unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Collins. In addition to the amounts included in the table above, during the second quarter of 2024, Raytheon initiated the termination of a fixed price development contract with a foreign customer. As a result of this action, Raytheon recognized a $0.6 billion charge related to the estimated impact of this termination. This charge includes the write-off of remaining contract assets and our best estimate of the expected settlement in conjunction with this termination.Significant EAC adjustments, when they occur, are discussed in each business segment's discussion below.Backlog and Bookings. Total backlog was $221 billion and $196 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total backlog includes commercial backlog of $131 billion and $118 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and defense backlog of $90 billion and $78 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Raytheon backlog was reduced by $1.1 billion as a result of the sale of the CIS business. 43Table of ContentsWe believe bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense businesses. Our defense operations consist primarily of our Raytheon business and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins and Pratt & Whitney segments. Defense bookings were approximately $25 billion and $12 billion for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately $47 billion and $37 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.Bookings are impacted by the timing and amounts of awards in a given period, which are subject to numerous factors, including: the desired capability by the customer and urgency of customer needs, customer budgets and other fiscal constraints, political and economic and other environmental factors, the timing of customer negotiations, and the timing of customer and governmental approvals and notifications. In addition, due to these factors, quarterly bookings tend to fluctuate from period to period, particularly on a segment basis.Collins Aerospace Quarter Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)20242023Change20242023ChangeNet sales$7,075$6,6297 %$20,747$19,1338 %Operating profit1,06290318 %3,0292,69912 %Operating profit margins15.0 %13.6 %14.6 %14.1 %Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions)Organic (1)Acquisitions /Divestitures, netRestructuringCostsOtherTotal ChangeNet sales$387 $- $- $59 $446 Operating profit54 - 52 53 159 (1) See \\\"Segment Review\\\" above for definition of organic.

While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally expect to recover the related Raytheon pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins and Pratt & Whitney generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis. 48Table of ContentsThe components of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment were as follows:Quarter Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)2024202320242023FAS service cost (expense)$(34)$(38)$(103)$(110)CAS expense244 310 739 955 FAS/CAS operating adjustment$210 $272 $636 $845 The changes in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion in the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were driven by a decrease in CAS expense, primarily due to the recognition of historical CAS gain/loss experience.

Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, customer financing requirements, investments in and divestitures of businesses, dividends, common stock repurchases, pension funding, access to 49Table of Contentsthe commercial paper markets, adequacy of available bank lines of credit, redemptions of debt, and the ability to attract long-term capital at satisfactory terms. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.7 billion, of which approximately 30% was held by RTX's foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The Company intends to repatriate certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. Taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings have been recorded. For the remainder of the Company's undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, RTX will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. Our ability to access global debt markets and the related cost of these borrowings depends on the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our S&P Global credit rating remains at BBB+/negative, and our Moody's Investors Service outlook is Baa1/negative. Though the Company expects to continue having adequate access to funds, declines in our credit ratings or Company outlook could result in higher borrowing costs.As of September 30, 2024, we had a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $5.0 billion, which expires in August 2028. As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement. From time to time, we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments, and repurchases of our common stock. The commercial paper notes have original maturities of not more than 364 days from the date of issuance. As of September 30, 2024, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. At September 30, 2024, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.We made the following repayments of long-term debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:DateDescription of NotesAggregate Principal Balance (in millions)May 7, 20243 Month SOFR plus 1.225% Term Loan due 2025$250 April 17, 20243 Month SOFR plus 1.225% Term Loan due 2025250 April 4, 20243 Month SOFR plus 1.225% Term Loan due 2025250 March 15, 20243.200% notes due 2024950 We have an existing universal shelf registration statement, which we filed with the SEC on September 22, 2022, for an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future issuance, subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement.The Company offers voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) programs with global financial institutions which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institutions at a rate that leverages our credit rating, which might be beneficial to them. Our suppliers' participation in the SCF programs does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers, and therefore, we have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the programs. In addition, we do not pay for any of the costs of the programs incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate, and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to sales of receivables made by those suppliers. As such, the SCF programs do not impact our working capital, cash flows, or overall liquidity.We believe our cash on hand and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Further, we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, as well as the availability under committed credit lines, provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required or appropriate.Cash Flow - Operating Activities Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)20242023Net cash flows provided by operating activities$5,598 $3,172 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a $0.9 billion charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters and a $0.4 billion, net of tax, charge related to the anticipated Raytheon Contract Termination, both of which did not have a significant impact on cash flow in the period. These charges also had the effect of increasing Other accrued liabilities by $1.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 50Table of Contentsincluded a $2.2 billion charge related to the Powder Metal Matter, net of tax, which had no effect on cash flow in that period. This charge also had the effect of increasing Other accrued liabilities by $2.8 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the impact of these charges, the $3.0 billion change in cash flows provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by a favorable impact from accounts receivable driven by increased sales volume and timing of collections, including the related impact of factoring as discussed below, a favorable change in accounts payable driven by timing of payments and an increase in material purchases, and lower tax payments year-over-year including a tax refund received in the second quarter of 2024. These favorable changes were partially offset by the net change in contract assets and contract liabilities due to the timing of collections, and a decrease in Other accrued liabilities due to utilization of the Powder Metal Matter accrual as a result of customer compensation. The Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-parties to sell certain of its receivables, primarily related to customer facilitated programs. The activity in these agreements is generally dependent on underlying delivery volumes within our commercial OEM programs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, factoring activity resulted in an increase of approximately $0.9 billion in cash provided by operating activities, compared to an increase of approximately $0.4 billion in cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Factoring activity includes amounts factored on certain aerospace receivables at the customer's request for which we may be compensated by the customer.We made net tax payments of $0.6 billion and $1.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.While the timing of cash flows are subject to a number of variables, for the Powder Metal Matter we estimate the accrual for expected customer compensation to be utilized consistent with the timing of execution of the fleet management plan, the period of increased aircraft on ground levels, and contractual terms with customers. We currently estimate a full year 2024 cash impact related to the Powder Metal Matter of approximately $1.0 billion. Additionally, we currently estimate full year 2024 cash payments of approximately $1.0 billion related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters and approximately $0.5 billion for the Raytheon Contract Termination executed subsequent to September 30, 2024.Cash Flow - Investing Activities Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)20242023Net cash flows used in investing activities$(755)$(2,061)Our investing activities primarily include capital expenditures, cash investments in customer financing assets, investments in and dispositions of businesses, payments related to our collaboration intangible assets and contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, and settlements of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments. The $1.3 billion change in cash flows used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily related to the sale of our CIS business within our Raytheon segment for proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion in cash.During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we increased other intangible assets by $0.4 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, primarily related to collaboration payment commitments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce's collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE) and exclusivity payments made on contractual commitments included within intangible assets.Cash Flow - Financing Activities Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)20242023Net cash flows used in financing activities$(4,749)$(1,909)Our financing activities primarily include the issuance and repayment of commercial paper and other short-term and long-term debt, payment of dividends, and stock repurchases. The $2.8 billion change in cash flows used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by prior year long-term debt issuances of $3.0 billion, an increase in long-term debt repayments of $1.5 billion, and lower issuances of commercial paper, net, of $0.5 billion, partially offset by lower year-over-year share repurchases of $2.2 billion. Refer to \\\"Note 9: Borrowings and Lines of Credit\\\" within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information on debt issuances and repayments and commercial paper.At September 30, 2024, management had remaining authority to repurchase approximately $0.7 billion of our common stock under the October 21, 2023 share repurchase program. Under the 2023 program, shares may be purchased on the open market, 51Table of Contentsin privately negotiated transactions, under accelerated share repurchase programs, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

In order to better understand such changes, readers of this MD&A should also read:\\u2022The discussion of the critical and significant accounting policies used by the Company in preparing its consolidated financial statements. The most current discussion of our critical accounting policies appears in Item 7, Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2022 Form 10-K, and the most current discussion of our significant accounting policies appears in Note 2- Significant Accounting Polices in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2022 Form 10-K;\\u2022The Company\\u2019s fiscal 2022 audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2022 Form 10-K; and\\u2022Item\\u00a07, Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2022 Form 10-K.In addition to historical information, this MD&A and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements that do not directly relate to any historical or current fact. When used herein, words such as \\u201cexpects,\\u201d \\u201canticipates,\\u201d \\u201cbelieves,\\u201d \\u201cseeks,\\u201d \\u201cestimates,\\u201d \\u201cplans,\\u201d \\u201cintends,\\u201d \\u201cfuture,\\u201d \\u201cwill,\\u201d \\u201cwould,\\u201d \\u201ccould,\\u201d \\u201ccan,\\u201d \\u201cmay,\\u201d and similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make concerning our business, financial condition and results of operations and our expectations as to our future growth, prospects, financial outlook and business strategy for fiscal year 2023 or future fiscal years, our expectations for the percentage of backlog we will realize as revenue in fiscal year 2023, and the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or the strategic investment in PA Consulting. Although such statements are based on management\\u2019s current estimates and expectations, and/or currently available competitive, financial, and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. We caution the reader that there are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. Such factors include our ability to execute on our three-year corporate strategy, including our ability to invest in the tools needed to fully implement our strategy, competition from existing and future competitors in our target markets, our ability to achieve the cost-savings and synergies contemplated by our recent acquisitions within the expected time frames or to achieve them fully and to successfully integrate acquired businesses while retaining key personnel, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic, and any resulting economic downturn on our results, prospects and opportunities, measures or restrictions imposed by governments and health officials in response to such pandemic, the timing of the award of projects and funding and potential changes to the amounts provided for, under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, financial market risks that may affect the Company, including by affecting the Company's access to capital, the cost of such capital and/or the Company's funding obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, as well as general economic conditions, including inflation and the actions taken by monetary authorities in response to inflation, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in capital markets, the impact of a possible recession or economic downturn on our results, prospects and opportunities, and geopolitical events and conflicts, among others. The impact of such matters includes, but is not limited to, the possible reduction in demand for certain of our product solutions and services and the delay or abandonment of ongoing or anticipated projects due to the financial condition of our clients and suppliers or to governmental budget constraints or changes to governmental budgetary priorities; the inability of our clients to meet their payment obligations in a timely manner or at all; potential issues and risks related to a significant portion of our employees working remotely; illness, travel restrictions and other workforce disruptions that have and could continue to negatively affect our supply chain and our ability to timely and satisfactorily complete our clients\\u2019 projects; difficulties associated with retaining and hiring additional employees; and the inability of governments in certain of the countries in which we operate to effectively mitigate the financial or other impacts of pandemics on their economies and workforces and our operations therein. The foregoing factors and potential future developments are inherently uncertain, unpredictable and, in many cases, beyond our control. For a description of these and additional factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see those listed and discussed in Item\\u00a01A, Risk Factors included in our 2022 Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements. We encourage you to read carefully the risk factors, as well as the financial and business disclosures contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other documents we file from time to time with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \\\"SEC\\\").Page 33Business OverviewAt Jacobs, we\\u2019re challenging today to reinvent tomorrow by solving the world\\u2019s most critical problems for thriving cities, resilient environments, mission-critical outcomes, operational advancement, scientific discovery and cutting-edge manufacturing, turning abstract ideas into realities that transform the world for good. Leveraging a talent force of more than 60,000, Jacobs provides a full spectrum of professional services including consulting, technical, engineering, scientific and project delivery for the government and private sectors.Our previous three-year corporate strategy launched at our Investor Day in February 2019 focused on innovation and continued transformation to build upon our position as the leading solutions provider for our clients. Setting the wheels in motion for our current path, this transformation included acquiring a 65% stake in PA Consulting Group Limited (\\\"PA Consulting\\\") in fiscal year 2021. Acquisitions of John Wood Group\\u2019s nuclear business, The Buffalo Group and most recently BlackLynx and StreetLight further position us as a leader in high-value government services and technology-enabled solutions.We are now focused on broadening our leadership in sustainable, high growth sectors. As part of our strategy, our brand promise: \\\"Challenging today. Reinventing tomorrow.\\\" signals our transition to a global technology-forward solutions company. We began trading as \\u201cJ\\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2019, and in March 2021 our Global Industry Classifications Standard code changed to Research & Consulting Services. Our Focus 2023 Transformation Office is charged with driving further innovation, delivering value-creating solutions for our clients and leveraging an integrated digital and technology strategy to improve our efficiency and effectiveness, ultimately freeing up valuable time and resources for reinvestment in our people.In the fourth quarter fiscal 2022, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (the predecessor parent company) created a new holding company, Jacobs Solutions Inc., which, through a reverse triangular merger, became the new parent company of Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. As a result of the transaction, the predecessor parent company's then-current stockholders automatically became stockholders of Jacobs Solutions Inc., on a one-for-one basis, with the same number of shares and same ownership percentage of the predecessor parent company\\u2019s common stock that they held immediately prior to the transaction.

While operating profit levels were up for the respective three-month periods of fiscal 2023 due primarily to our P&PS business, the first fiscal quarter of 2023 was impacted by $39.7 million in pre-tax Restructuring and other charges and transaction costs compared to fiscal 2022 amounts of $75.0\\u00a0million, for both periods associated mainly with the Company's transformation initiatives relating to real estate which is discussed in Note 16- Restructuring and Other Charges. Additionally, the 2023 first fiscal quarter was impacted by approximately $15.0 million in net favorable impacts from overhead cost reductions associated mainly with one-time benefit program changes, while partly offset by higher incentive and other compensation charges and higher investments in company technology platforms. Also, first quarter fiscal 2023 other expense, net, of $40.3 million was higher by $32.1\\u00a0million versus first quarter fiscal 2022 amounts of $8.2 million, with the current period primarily impacted by unfavorable higher net interest expense compared to the prior year quarter as discussed further below. Our reported net earnings for the current year quarter were unfavorably impacted by higher income taxes of $34.2 million compared to the fiscal 2022 period, attributable to higher effective tax rates in the current quarter due mainly to the absence of prior year tax benefits including $15.7\\u00a0million related to the release of previously valued foreign tax credits and other prior year favorable tax items combined with current quarter income tax expense items further discussed in Note 9- Income Taxes. Additionally, redeemable noncontrolling interests was $5.7\\u00a0million lower in the current quarter due to unfavorable net earnings results in our PA Consulting investment compared to the prior year quarter. On February 4, 2022, the Company acquired StreetLight Data, Inc., (\\\"StreetLight\\\"). For further discussion, see Note 15- Other Business Combinations.Consolidated Results of OperationsRevenues for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 were $3.80 billion, an increase of $418.0 million, or 12.4%, from $3.38 billion for the corresponding period last year. Revenue increases for the year over year period were due mainly to the Company's P&PS and CMS legacy businesses and in addition, to a smaller degree, fiscal 2023 incremental revenues benefited from the StreetLight acquisition (owned for the full period in fiscal 2023) and other increases in our DVS business. The P&PS business benefited primarily from stronger performance in its Advanced Facilities and U.S. business operations. Our CMS business benefited from increased spending in our U.S. government business sector, which was primarily attributable to fiscal 2022 contract awards for the U.S. Department of Energy. Due to foreign currency translation impacts, revenues in our PA Consulting investment decreased (excluding translation impacts, PA Consulting experienced year over year growth). Also, revenue was unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation of $158.5 million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 in our international businesses, with no significant impact in the prior year period. Pass-through costs included in revenues for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 amounted to $673.7 million, an increase of $195.6 million, or 40.9%, from $478.1 million from the corresponding period last year.Gross profit for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 was $814.7 million, an increase of $18.2 million, or 2.3%, from $796.5 million from the corresponding period last year. Our gross profit margins were 21.4% and 23.6% for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 and December\\u00a031, 2021, respectively, with these margin differences being mainly attributable to lower utilization trends primarily in the PA Consulting business, project mix impacts in our legacy CMS portfolio and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts, partly offset by new program startups won in fiscal 2022 and favorable performance in our P&PS advanced facilities and U.S. businesses. Additionally, gross profit benefited from favorable impacts from overhead cost reductions associated mainly with one-time benefit program changes, while partly offset by higher incentive and other compensation charges and higher investments in company technology platforms in the current year, as mentioned above.See Segment Financial Information discussion for further information on the Company\\u2019s results of operations at the operating segment.SG&A expenses for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 were $576.9 million, a decrease of $42.2 million or (6.8)% from $619.1 million for the corresponding period last year. The current year's three months ended results were impacted by decreases in real estate related costs, as well as other department spend decreases due in part to the Company's transformation initiatives. Also, Restructuring and other charges for fiscal 2023 and 2022 included $27.1 million and $73.2\\u00a0million, respectively, in costs associated with the Company's transformation initiatives relating to real Page 37estate. Lastly, SG&A expenses benefited from favorable foreign exchange impacts of $27.5 million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022, with no significant impact in the corresponding prior year period. Net interest expense for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was $37.1 million, an increase of $19.1 million from $17.9 million for the corresponding period last year. The increase in net interest expense for the three month period was due to higher levels of debt outstanding due to the funding of the StreetLight and BlackLynx acquisitions and increased borrowings associated with the payment of the settlement of a legacy litigation matter involving a subsidiary of CH2M (the \\\"Legacy CH2M Matter\\\") in fiscal 2022, in addition to higher interest rates. Miscellaneous (expense) income, net for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was $(3.3) million in comparison to $9.7 million for the corresponding period last year. The $12.9 million decrease from the prior three-month comparable period was due primarily to an increase in pension costs due to higher interest rate impacts in the current year along with the prior year $6.9 million gain related to a lease termination.The Company\\u2019s effective tax rates from continuing operations for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 and December\\u00a031, 2021 were 25.4% and 9.4%, respectively. The most significant items contributing to the difference between the statutory U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21.0% and the Company\\u2019s effective tax rate for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 were U.S. state income tax expense of $4.6\\u00a0million and U.S. tax on foreign earnings of $3.6\\u00a0million. Both items are expected to have a continuing impact on the Company's effective tax rate for the remainder of the fiscal year. The most significant items contributing to the difference between the statutory U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21.0% and the Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended December\\u00a031, 2021 were a tax benefit of $15.7\\u00a0million related to the release of previously reserved foreign tax credit assets, $4.2\\u00a0million excess tax benefit attributable to stock compensation, and $4.0\\u00a0million benefit from filing amended state returns.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by tax jurisdictions around the world. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, India, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to our assessment of the relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at the time. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may impact our effective tax rate.Page 38Segment Financial InformationThe following table provides selected financial information for our operating segments and includes a reconciliation of segment operating profit to total U.S. GAAP operating profit from continuing operations by including certain corporate-level expenses, Restructuring and other charges and transaction and integration costs (in thousands).Three Months EndedDecember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Revenues from External Customers:Critical Mission Solutions$1,075,175\\u00a0$976,777\\u00a0People & Places Solutions2,226,985\\u00a01,920,997\\u00a0Divergent Solutions214,465\\u00a0192,877\\u00a0PA Consulting282,043\\u00a0289,974\\u00a0Total$3,798,668\\u00a0$3,380,625\\u00a0Three Months EndedDecember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Segment Operating Profit:Critical Mission Solutions$82,220\\u00a0$91,239\\u00a0People & Places Solutions226,619\\u00a0188,841\\u00a0Divergent Solutions11,967\\u00a023,108\\u00a0PA Consulting51,027\\u00a063,071\\u00a0Total Segment Operating Profit371,833\\u00a0366,259\\u00a0Other Corporate Expenses (1)(93,686)(105,360)Restructuring, Transaction and Other Charges (2)(40,342)(83,566)Total U.S. GAAP Operating Profit 237,805\\u00a0177,333\\u00a0Total Other Income (Expense), net (3)(40,324)(8,243)Earnings Before Taxes from Continuing Operations$197,481\\u00a0$169,090\\u00a0(1)Other corporate expenses included intangibles amortization of $49.8 million and $46.9 million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 and December\\u00a031, 2021, respectively. Additionally, the three month period of fiscal 2023 included approximately $15.0 million in net favorable impacts from cost reductions compared to the prior year period, which was associated mainly with net favorable impacts during the current quarter from changes in employee benefit programs of $41 million offset by approximately $26 million in higher quarter over quarter spend in company technology platforms and other personnel and corporate cost increases.(2)Included in the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 and December\\u00a031, 2021 are $27.1 million and $72.3 million, respectively, in real estate impairment charges related to the Company's transformation initiatives.(3)The three months ended December\\u00a031, 2021 included a gain of $6.9 million related to a lease termination. Additionally, the increase in net interest expense year over year is primarily due to the higher levels of debt outstanding due to the funding of the StreetLight and BlackLynx acquisitions in fiscal 2022 and increased borrowings associated with the payment of the Legacy CH2M Matter settlement also in the prior year, in addition to higher interest rates.Page 39Critical Mission SolutionsThree Months EndedDecember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Revenue$1,075,175\\u00a0$976,777\\u00a0Operating Profit$82,220\\u00a0$91,239\\u00a0Critical Mission Solutions (CMS) segment revenues for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 were $1.08 billion, an increase of $98.4 million, or 10.1%, from $976.8 million for the corresponding period last year. During the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022, revenue benefited from contracts awarded in late fiscal 2022, including the Department of Energy Nuclear remediation program. Also, impacts on revenues from unfavorable foreign currency translation were approximately $33.1\\u00a0million for the three month period ended December\\u00a030, 2022, compared to $2.2\\u00a0million in favorable impacts in the corresponding prior year period.Operating profit for the segment was $82.2 million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022, representing a decrease of $9.0 million, or (9.9)%, from $91.2 million for the corresponding period last year. Operating profit levels were down from the prior year, with impacts from large contract wind downs in early fiscal 2022, which carried higher profit margins, offset in part by growth in nuclear remediation work for the U.S. Department of Energy noted above. Impacts on operating profit from unfavorable foreign currency translation were approximately $3.9\\u00a0million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022, as compared to insignificant impacts in the corresponding prior year period.People & Places SolutionsThree Months EndedDecember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Revenue$2,226,985\\u00a0$1,920,997\\u00a0Operating Profit$226,619\\u00a0$188,841\\u00a0Revenues for the People & Places Solutions (P&PS) segment for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was $2.23 billion, an increase of $306.0\\u00a0million, or 15.9%, from $1.92 billion for the corresponding period last year. The increase in revenue for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was primarily driven by growth in both our advanced facilities and U.S. businesses as compared to the prior year corresponding period. Foreign currency translation had a $83.2\\u00a0million unfavorable impact on revenues in our international businesses for the three period ended December\\u00a030, 2022, respectively, as compared to unfavorable impacts of $2.6\\u00a0million in the corresponding prior year period.Operating profit for the segment for the three month period ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was $226.6 million, an increase of $37.8 million, or 20.0%, from $188.8 million for the corresponding period last year. The year-over-year increase in operating profit for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was driven primarily by the revenue growth mentioned above while holding selling, general and administrative expenses relatively flat. Foreign currency translation had a $15.9\\u00a0million unfavorable impact on operating profit in our international businesses for the three month periods ended December\\u00a030, 2022, respectively as compared to insignificant impacts in the corresponding prior year period.Page 40Divergent SolutionsThree Months EndedDecember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Revenue$214,465\\u00a0$192,877\\u00a0Operating Profit$11,967\\u00a0$23,108\\u00a0Revenues for the Divergent Solutions segment for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 were $214.5\\u00a0million, an increase of $21.6 million, or 11.2%, from $192.9 million for the corresponding period last year. The increase in revenue for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 benefited from incremental revenues from the StreetLight acquisition (owned for the full period in fiscal 2023) and the startup of new programs previously won in fiscal 2022. Foreign currency translation impacts on revenue were not significant for either period.Operating profit for the segment was $12.0 million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022, a decrease of $11.1 million, or 48.2%, from $23.1 million, for the corresponding period last year. The decrease in operating profit for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was primarily driven by unfavorable impacts of changes in overhead billing rates during the current year quarter of 2023 vs. the prior year quarter mainly in our cyber intelligence market. Impacts on operating profit from foreign currency were not significant for either period.PA ConsultingThree Months EndedDecember 30, 2022December 31, 2021Revenue$282,043\\u00a0$289,974\\u00a0Operating Profit$51,027\\u00a0$63,071\\u00a0Revenues for the PA Consulting segment for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 were $282.0 million, a decrease of $7.9 million, or 2.7%, from $290.0 million for the corresponding period last year. The decrease in revenue for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was driven by foreign currency translation which had a $41.6 million unfavorable impact on revenues in our international businesses for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022, and a favorable impact of $5.3\\u00a0million for the corresponding prior year quarter. In local currency (primarily GBP), PA Consulting experienced an approximate 10% increase in revenues as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher volumes in PA Consulting's existing business for previously delayed projects in fiscal 2022.Operating profit for the segment for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was $51.0 million, a decrease of $12.0 million, or 19.1%, from $63.1 million, for the corresponding period last year, with the decrease partly due to unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts in our international business of $6.9 million as compared to $1.0\\u00a0million in favorable impact in the corresponding prior year period. Additionally, operating profit was impacted by lower utilization as compared to the prior year quarter. Other Corporate Expenses Other corporate expenses for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 were $93.7 million, a decrease of $11.7 million from $105.4 million for the corresponding period last year. This decrease during the three month period was primarily driven by approximately $15.0 million in net favorable impacts from overhead cost reductions associated mainly with one-time benefit program changes, while partly offset by higher incentive and other compensation charges and higher investments in company technology platforms.Included in other corporate expenses are costs and expenses which relate to general corporate activities as well as corporate-managed benefit and insurance programs. Such costs and expenses include: (i) those elements of SG&A expenses relating to the business as a whole; (ii) those elements of our incentive compensation plans relating to corporate personnel whose other compensation costs are not allocated to the LOBs; (iii) the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations; (iv) the quarterly variances between the Company\\u2019s actual costs of certain of its self-insured integrated risk and employee benefit programs and amounts charged to the LOBs; and (v) certain adjustments relating to costs associated with the Company\\u2019s international defined benefit pension plans. In addition, other corporate expenses may also include from time to time certain adjustments to contract margins (both positive and negative) Page 41associated with projects, as well as other items, where it has been determined that such adjustments are not indicative of the performance of the related LOB.Restructuring and Other ChargesSee Note 16- Restructuring and Other Charges for information on the Company\\u2019s activity relating to restructuring and other charges.Backlog InformationWe include in backlog the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. Our policy with respect to Operations & Maintenance (\\\"O&M\\\") contracts, however, is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year, regardless of the remaining life of the contract. For national government programs (other than national government O&M contracts, which are subject to the same policy applicable to all other O&M contracts), our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, excluding option periods. Because of variations in the nature, size, expected duration, funding commitments, and the scope of services required by our contracts, the timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues can vary greatly between individual contracts. Consistent with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client, including our U.S. government work. While management uses all information available to determine backlog, at any given time our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein. Backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues.Because certain contracts (e.g., contracts relating to large Engineering, Procurement & Construction (\\\"EPC\\\") projects as well as national government programs) can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award, and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over several fiscal quarters (and sometimes over fiscal years), we have presented our backlog on a year-over-year basis, rather than on a sequential, quarter-over-quarter basis.The following table summarizes our backlog at December\\u00a030, 2022 and December\\u00a031, 2021 (in millions):December 30, 2022December 31, 2021Critical Mission Solutions$7,632\\u00a0$7,525\\u00a0People & Places Solutions17,243\\u00a016,930\\u00a0Divergent Solutions3,077\\u00a03,275\\u00a0PA Consulting306\\u00a0276\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Total$28,258\\u00a0$28,006\\u00a0The increase in backlog in Critical Mission Solutions (CMS) from December\\u00a031, 2021 was primarily driven by new business awards in the U.S. government space and nuclear remediation sectors offsetting slower growth in the U.S. Defense market.The increase in backlog in People & Places Solutions (P&PS) from December\\u00a031, 2021 was primarily driven by new business awards in our federal, environmental and advanced facilities business.The decrease in backlog in Divergent Solutions (DVS) from December\\u00a031, 2021 was primarily driven by delays of new awards because of continuing resolution throughout fiscal 2022. The increase in backlog in PA Consulting from December\\u00a031, 2021 was primarily driven by strategic focus on long-term projects as well as organic year over year growth of the business.Page 42Consolidated backlog differs from the Company\\u2019s remaining performance obligations as defined by ASC 606 primarily because of our national government contracts (other than national government O&M contracts). Our policy is to generally include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded excluding the option periods while our remaining performance obligations represent a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Additionally, the Company includes our proportionate share of backlog related to unconsolidated joint ventures which is not included in our remaining performance obligations.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt December\\u00a030, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.21 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $637.9 million of available borrowing capacity under our $2.25 billion revolving credit agreement (the \\\"Revolving Credit Facility\\\"). We finance much of our operations and growth through cash generated by our operations.The amount of cash and cash equivalents at December\\u00a030, 2022 represented an increase of $70.6 million from $1.14 billion at September\\u00a030, 2022, the reasons for which are described below. Our net cash flow provided by operations of $302.3 million during the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was unfavorable by $19.3 million in comparison to the cash flow provided by operations of $321.6 million for the corresponding prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in cash from operations is primarily attributable to lower earnings after adjustments for non-cash items compared to the prior period, in addition to a small decrease in working capital performance compared to the prior period.Our net cash used for investing activities for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 was $48.7 million, compared to cash used for investing activities of $249.6 million in the corresponding prior year period, with this change due primarily to the acquisition of BlackLynx in the prior year.Our net cash used for financing activities of $246.1 million for the three months ended December\\u00a030, 2022 resulted mainly from cash used for share repurchases of $140.5 million, $58.4 million in repurchase of redeemable noncontrolling interests and $29.8 million in dividends to shareholders and $2.3 million in dividends to noncontrolling interest holders, partly offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock of $14.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities in the corresponding prior year period was $144.4 million, due primarily to net proceeds from borrowings of $231.4 million, offset by cash used for repurchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests of $35.1 million and $27.5 million in dividends to shareholders and $14.1 million in net dividends to noncontrolling interest holders.At December\\u00a030, 2022, the Company had approximately $210.0\\u00a0million in cash and cash equivalents held in the U.S. and $1.0\\u00a0billion held outside of the U.S. (primarily in the U.K., the Eurozone, Australia, India, Canada, Israel and the United Arab Emirates), which is used primarily for funding operations in those regions. Other than the tax cost of repatriating funds to the U.S. (see Note 6- Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2022 Form 10-K), there are no material impediments to repatriating these funds to the U.S.The Company had $292.5 million in letters of credit outstanding at December\\u00a030, 2022. Of this amount, $1.3 million was issued under the Revolving Credit Facility and $291.2 million was issued under separate, committed and uncommitted letter-of-credit facilities.On February 6, 2023, the Company refinanced its Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities. See Note 11- Borrowings for further discussion relating to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities following the refinancing.Page 43On February 4, 2022, the Company acquired StreetLight Data, Inc. (\\\"StreetLight\\\"). StreetLight is a pioneer of mobility analytics who uses its data and machine learning resources to shed light on mobility and enable users to solve complex transportation problems. The Company paid total base consideration of approximately $190.8 million in cash, and issued $0.9 million in equity and $5.2 million in in-the-money stock options to the former owners of StreetLight. The Company also paid off StreetLight's debt of approximately $1.0 million simultaneously with the consummation of the acquisition. On November 19, 2021, Jacobs acquired all outstanding shares of common stock of BlackLynx, a provider of high-performance software, to complement Jacobs' portfolio of cyber, intelligence and digital solutions. The Company paid total base consideration of approximately $235.4\\u00a0million in cash to the former owners of BlackLynx. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company also paid off BlackLynx's debt of approximately $5.3\\u00a0million simultaneously with the consummation of the acquisition. We believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our projected cash requirements for the next twelve months based on the liquidity provided by our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our borrowing capacity and our continuing cash from operations.

Our reportable segments are Residential Heating & Cooling, Commercial Heating & Cooling, and Refrigeration.  For  additional information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 16 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our fiscal quarterly periods are comprised of approximately 13 weeks, but the number of days per quarter may vary year-over-year. Our quarterly reporting periods usually end on the Saturday closest to the last day of March, June and September. Our fourth quarter and fiscal year ends on December 31, regardless of the day of the week on which December 31 falls.  For convenience, throughout this Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the 13-week periods comprising each fiscal quarter are denoted by the last day of the respective calendar quarter.We sell our products and services through a combination of direct sales, distributors and company-owned parts and supplies stores. The demand for our products and services is seasonal and significantly impacted by the weather.  Warmer than normal summer temperatures generate demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services, and colder than normal winter temperatures have a similar effect on heating products and services.  Conversely, cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress the demand for HVACR products and services.  In addition to weather, demand for our products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors, such as interest rates, the availability of financing, regional population and employment trends, new construction, general economic conditions, and consumer spending habits and confidence.  A substantial portion of the sales in each of our business segments is attributable to replacement business, with the balance comprised of new construction business.The principal elements of cost of goods sold are components, raw materials, factory overhead, labor, estimated warranty costs, and freight and distribution costs.  The principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, copper and aluminum.  In recent years, pricing volatility for these commodities and related components, including the impact of newly imposed tariffs on the import of certain of our raw materials and components, has impacted us and the HVACR industry in general.  We seek to mitigate the impact of volatility in commodity prices through a combination of price increases, commodity contracts, improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives. We also partially mitigate volatility in the prices of these commodities by entering into futures contracts and fixed forward contracts.\\u00a0\\u00a0Marshalltown TornadoOn July 19, 2018, our manufacturing facility in Marshalltown, Iowa was damaged by a tornado.  Insurance covers the repair or replacement of our assets that suffered damage or loss, and we are working closely with our insurance carriers and claims adjusters to ascertain the amount of insurance recoveries due to us as a result of the damage and loss we suffered. Our insurance 36policies also provide business interruption coverage, including lost profits, and reimbursement for other expenses and costs that have been incurred relating to the damages and losses suffered.  In the third quarter of 2019, we incurred expenses of $3 million related to damages caused by the tornado, which included site clean-up and demolition, factory inefficiencies, freight to move product to other warehouses and sales and marketing promotional costs.  We received insurance recoveries of $10 million in the third quarter of 2019 and allocated the first $2 million of these proceeds to cover our expenses and rebuilding costs incurred during the quarter and allocated the remaining $8 million for lost profits.  These amounts are included in (Gain) loss from insurance recoveries, net of losses incurred in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we expect to receive insurance proceeds of $94 million related to lost profits and $154 million to fund the reconstruction of the facility and as reimbursement for other losses and expenses expected to be incurred. We expect to receive a cumulative total of $121 million in insurance proceeds related to lost profits and a cumulative total of $251 million to fund the reconstruction of the facility and as reimbursement for other losses and expenses expected to be incurred.Financial OverviewResults for the third quarter of 2019 were driven by year over year sales and profit growth in our Residential Heating & Cooling and Commercial Heating & Cooling segments.  The Residential Heating & Cooling segment saw a 7% increase in net sales primarily on higher volumes and their segment profit was up $14 million, including the impact of insurance proceeds received for lost profits.  The Commercial Heating & Cooling segment had a 7% increase in net sales and a $2 million increase in segment profit which were driven by higher volumes and higher price and mix.  Sales in our Refrigeration segment decreased by 28%  primarily due to the sale of our South America and Kysor Warren businesses in prior quarters, and segment profit declined $5 million.  Financial Highlights \\u2022Net sales increased $3 million to $1,033 million in the third quarter of 2019.  Growth in our Residential Heating & Cooling and Commercial Heating & Cooling segments were offset by a sales decline in our Refrigeration segment due to the sale of our South America and Kysor Warren businesses in prior quarters.  \\u2022Operating income in the third quarter of 2019 increased $12 million to $157 million due primarily to insurance proceeds for lost profits related to the Marshalltown tornado.\\u2022Net income for the third quarter of 2019 increased $7 million to $115 million.  \\u2022Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.94 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2.65 per share in the third quarter of 2018.\\u2022For the nine months ended September\\u00a030, 2019, we returned $81 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased $400 million of common stock.

Higher sales volume across all of our segments contributed 4% and favorable combined price and mix in our Residential Heating & Cooling and Commercial Heating & Cooing segments contributed 1%.  These were partially offset by a 5% decline related to the loss of sales related to our South America and Kysor Warren businesses.Gross Profit Gross profit margin in the third quarter of 2019 decreased to 28.9% compared to 29.3% in the third quarter of 2018.  We saw decreases in profit margin of 150 basis points (\\\"bps\\\") from lower factory efficiency and higher other product costs, and 70 bps from higher freight and distribution costs.  Partially offsetting these decreases were positive margin increases of 40 bps from favorable price and mix, 40 bps from sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, 20 bps from lower commodity costs, 10 bps from favorable product warranty costs, and 70 bps from the divested South America and Kysor Warren businesses which had lower margins. Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A declined $6 million to $143 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $149 million in the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to the sale of our South America and Kysor Warren businesses.  As a percentage of net sales, SG&A decreased 60 bps to 13.9% primarily due to a decline in SG&A from our divested business and lower short-term and long-term incentive compensation costs. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Losses (Gains) and Other Expenses, NetLosses (gains) and other expenses, net for the third quarter of 2019 and 2018 included the following (in millions):\\u00a0For the Three Months Ended September 30,\\u00a02019\\u00a02018Realized losses (gains) on settled future contracts $0.1\\u00a0$0.2Foreign currency exchange gains(0.3)\\u00a00.1Other operating (gains) losses(1.2)\\u00a0\\u2014Net change in unrealized losses (gains) on unsettled futures contracts 0.1\\u00a00.2Special legal contingency charges 0.3\\u00a00.1Asbestos-related litigation 1.5\\u00a01.4Environmental liabilities 1.1\\u00a00.2Other items, net 0.6\\u00a00.5Losses (gains) and other expenses, net (pre-tax)$2.2\\u00a0$2.7The net change in unrealized losses (gains) on unsettled futures contracts was due to changes in commodity prices relative to the unsettled futures contract prices.  For more information on our futures contracts, see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The environmental liabilities relate to estimated remediation costs for contamination at some of our facilities.  Refer to Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the divestiture costs. Restructuring ChargesRestructuring charges were $6 million in the third quarter of 2019 and primarily related to activities to re-align resources and the product portfolio in our Commercial Heating & Cooling and Corporate segments.  For additional information on our restructuring activities, refer to Note 13 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.38Loss on Sale of BusinessesWe recognized a loss of $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2019 related to the sale of our Kysor Warren business.  Refer to Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Income from Equity Method InvestmentsWe participate in two joint ventures that are engaged in the manufacture and sale of compressors, unit coolers and condensing units. We exert significant influence over these affiliates based upon our ownership, but do not control them due to venture partner participation.  Accordingly, these joint ventures have been accounted for under the equity method and their financial position and results of operations are not consolidated.  Income from equity method investments of $3 million in the third quarter of 2019 increased $1 million compared to the third quarter of 2018 on improved operating performance of the joint ventures.  Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net of $13 million in the third quarter of 2019 was up from $10 million in the third quarter of 2018 due to an increase in our average net borrowings.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate increased to 20.2% for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 19.3% for the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to the recording of unrecognized tax benefits.  We expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 22% and 23%, excluding the impact of excess tax benefits recorded as a reduction of income taxes under ASU No. 2016-09.Third Quarter of 2019 Compared to Third Quarter of 2018 - Results by SegmentResidential Heating & Cooling The following table presents our Residential Heating & Cooling segment's net sales and profit for the third quarter of 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\\u00a0For the Three Months Ended September 30,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a02019\\u00a02018\\u00a0Difference\\u00a0% ChangeNet sales$637.6\\u00a0$594.7\\u00a0$42.9\\u00a07.2%Profit$126.5\\u00a0$113.0\\u00a0$13.5\\u00a011.9%% of net sales19.8%\\u00a019.0%\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Net sales increased 7% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018.

For additional information, refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net of $37 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased from $29 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to an increase in our average net borrowings.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate declined to 19.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to 21.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 primarily due to the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.\\u00a042Year-to-Date through September 30, 2019 Compared to Year-to-Date through September 30, 2018 - Results by SegmentResidential Heating & Cooling The following table presents our Residential Heating & Cooling segment's net sales and profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\\u00a0For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a02019\\u00a02018\\u00a0Difference\\u00a0% ChangeNet sales$1,792.2\\u00a0$1,764.4\\u00a0$27.8\\u00a01.6%Profit$366.6\\u00a0$317.9\\u00a0$48.7\\u00a015.3%% of net sales20.5%\\u00a018.0%\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Net sales increased 2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to higher combined price and mix.Segment profit increased $49 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to $74 million of insurance proceeds for lost profits related to the Marshalltown tornado, $33 million of favorable price and mix, $11 million of sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, and $1 million of higher equity method income.  Partially offsetting these increases is $25 million of higher freight and distribution expenses, $11 million of higher SG&A, $9 million from lower factory efficiency, $8 million of higher commodity costs, $7 million of lower sales volume, $8 million of higher other product costs, $1 million of higher tariffs on imported Chinese components, and $1 million of unfavorable foreign exchange rates.Commercial Heating & CoolingThe following table presents our Commercial Heating & Cooling segment's net sales and profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\\u00a0For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a02019\\u00a02018\\u00a0Difference\\u00a0% ChangeNet sales$687.9\\u00a0$668.1\\u00a0$19.8\\u00a03.0\\u00a0%Profit$116.0\\u00a0$117.6\\u00a0$(1.6)\\u00a0(1.4)%% of net sales16.9%\\u00a017.6%\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Net sales increased 3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to 4% higher combined price and mix partially offset by 1% lower sales volume.\\u00a0Segment profit decreased $2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to $7 million of higher other product costs, $5 million from lower factory efficiency, $5 million of higher commodity costs, $4 million of higher freight and distribution expense, $4 million of higher SG&A expense, $3 million of lower sales volume, and $2 million of higher tariffs on Chinese imports.  Partially offsetting these decreases was $23 million of higher price and mix combined, $4 million of sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, and $1 million of higher equity method income.43Refrigeration The following table presents our Refrigeration segment's net sales and profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\\u00a0For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a02019\\u00a02018\\u00a0Difference\\u00a0% ChangeNet sales$442.1\\u00a0$607.9\\u00a0$(165.8)\\u00a0(27.3)%Profit$47.3\\u00a0$57.1\\u00a0$(9.8)\\u00a0(17.2)%% of net sales10.7%\\u00a09.4%\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Net sales decreased 27% in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018.  The loss of sales from our divested Australia, New Zealand, Asia, South America and Kysor Warren businesses contributed 27% and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates contributed 1%, partially offset by 1% favorable combined price and mix.Segment profit in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 decreased $10 million due to $4 million of lower profit due to the divested Australia, New Zealand, Asia, South America and Kysor Warren businesses, $3 million of higher commodity costs, $3 million of lower European refrigerant allocation sales, $2 million from lower factory efficiency, $2 million of higher tariffs on Chinese imports, $2 million of higher other product costs, $1 million of higher SG&A expense, $1 million of higher freight and distribution expense, and $1 million of lower equity method income.  Partially offsetting these declines was $5 million of sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, $3 million of higher combined price and mix, and $1 million of higher sales volume.Corporate and OtherCorporate and other expenses decreased $8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018 due to lower short-term and long-term incentive compensation.Liquidity and Capital Resources Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through internally generated funds, bank lines of credit and an asset securitization arrangement.  Working capital needs are generally greater in the first and second quarters due to the seasonal nature of our business cycle.Statement of Cash FlowsThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\\u00a0For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\\u00a02019\\u00a02018Net cash provided by operating activities$124.5\\u00a0$231.3Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities(23.1)\\u00a059.3Net cash used in financing activities(102.8)\\u00a0(316.6)Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities - The net cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30,  2019 and 2018 reflects the seasonal increase in working capital requirements. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to the timing of working capital payments and the supply disruption in 2018 caused by the tornado at our Marshalltown facility.Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities - Capital expenditures were $77 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $61 million in the same period of 2018.  Capital expenditures in 2019 were primarily related to the reconstruction of the Marshalltown facility as well as equipment and investments in systems and software to support the overall enterprise.  Net proceeds of $44 million in the first quarter of 2019 were provided by the sale of our Kysor Warren business. We also received $12 million in insurance proceeds to fund the reconstruction of our Marshalltown facility.44Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $103 million compared to $317 million in the same period of 2018.  The decrease in cash used in financing activities is largely due to higher net borrowings on our revolving credit facility partially offset by an increase in share repurchases in 2019 compared to 2018.  We repurchased $400 million of shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $350 million of shares in the same period of 2018.  We also returned $81 million to shareholders through dividend payments in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. For additional information on share repurchases, refer to Note 11 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Debt PositionThe following table details our lines of credit and financing arrangements as of September\\u00a030, 2019 (in millions): \\u00a0Outstanding BorrowingsCurrent maturities of long-term debt:\\u00a0Asset Securitization Program$365.5Capital lease obligations$6.9Domestic credit facility(1)22.5Debt issuance costs(0.6)\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Total current maturities of long-term debt$394.3Long-term debt:\\u00a0Asset Securitization Program (2)\\u2014Capital lease obligations23.7Domestic credit facility(1)685.5Senior unsecured notes350.0Debt issuance costs(2.4)\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Total long-term debt1,056.8Total debt$1,451.1(1) The available future borrowings on our domestic credit facility are $449.5 million after being reduced by the outstanding borrowings and $2.5 million in outstanding standby letters of credit.  We also had $29.6 million in outstanding standby letters of credit outside of the domestic credit facility as of September\\u00a030, 2019.(2) The maximum securitization amount ranges from $225.0 million to $380.0 million, depending on the period.  The maximum capacity of the ASP is the lesser of the maximum securitization amount or 100% of the net pool balance less reserves, as defined under the ASP.Financial LeverageWe periodically review our capital structure to ensure the appropriate levels of leverage and liquidity.  We may access the capital markets, as necessary, based on business needs and to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.  We also evaluate our debt-to-capital and debt-to-EBITDA ratios to determine, among other considerations, the appropriate targets for capital expenditures and share repurchases under our share repurchase programs.  Our debt-to-total-capital ratio increased to 123.6% at September\\u00a030, 2019 from 116.8% at December 31, 2018.   As of September 30, 2019, our senior credit ratings were Baa3 with a stable outlook, and BBB with a stable outlook, by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (\\\"Moody's\\\") and Standard & Poor's Rating Group (\\\"S&P\\\"), respectively.  The security ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.  Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Our goal is to maintain investment grade ratings from Moody's and S&P to help ensure the capital markets remain available to us.LiquidityWe believe our cash and cash equivalents of $46 million, future cash generated from operations and available future borrowings are sufficient to fund operations, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, potential share repurchases and dividends and other needs in the foreseeable future.  Included in our cash and cash equivalents of $46 million as of September\\u00a030, 452019 was $19 million of cash held in foreign locations.  Our cash held in foreign locations is used for investing and operating activities in those locations, and we generally do not have the need or intent to repatriate those funds to the United States.  An actual repatriation in the future from our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be subject to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes. Our expected capital expenditures for 2019 are $100 million, excluding capital expenditures made in conjunction with repair of our Marshalltown facility as those repairs will be covered by insurance.  We also continue to increase shareholder value through the $400 million of share repurchases completed in the nine months ended September 30, 2019.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which the company has: (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us. \\u00a0We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.Commitments, Contingencies and GuaranteesFor information regarding our commitments, contingencies and guarantees, see Note 7 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\",\n          \"Item 2.\\n\\nManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\\nThe following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both MAA and the Operating Partnership, of which MAA is the sole general partner and in which MAA owned a 96.6% interest as of March\\u00a031, 2021.

Revenues for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 increased 1.7% as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, driven by a 1.4% increase in our Same Store segment. Property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 increased by 6.1% as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, driven by a 5.4% increase in our Same Store segment. The drivers of these changes are discussed below in the \\u201cResults of Operations\\u201d section.\\nTrends \\nDuring the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, revenue growth for our Same Store portfolio continued to be favorably impacted by in-place rents and the contribution of average effective rent per unit growth. The average effective rent per unit for our Same Store portfolio continued to increase from the prior year, up 1.3% for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020. Average effective rent per unit represents the average of gross rent amounts, after the effect of leasing concessions, for occupied apartment units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied apartment units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. We believe average effective rent per unit is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing; however, it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit.\\nIn addition, for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, average physical occupancy for our Same Store portfolio was 95.7%, consistent with the average physical occupancy achieved during the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\u00a0\\u00a0Average physical occupancy is a measurement of the total number of our apartment units that are occupied by residents, and it represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the period.\\nAn important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and price points in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. This diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. We believe that a well-balanced portfolio, including both urban and suburban locations, with a broad range of monthly rent price points, will perform well in \\u201cup\\u201d cycles as well as better weather \\u201cdown\\u201d cycles. Through our \\n27\\n\\n\\u00a0\\ninvestment in 36 defined markets, we are diversified across markets, urban and suburban submarkets, and a variety of product types and monthly rent price points.\\nWhile the United States economy continues to recover somewhat from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains disruption from the pandemic and we cannot predict when a full economic recovery will occur. Demand for apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets and is particularly correlated to job growth.\\u00a0\\u00a0Government restrictions implemented in response to the pandemic continue to drive higher than normal unemployment and limit the number of people looking to change their current living situation.\\u00a0\\u00a0While our rent collections in the first quarter of 2021 improved as compared to the rent collections in the fourth quarter of 2020, the current environment could contribute to lower than normal rent collections going forward and continue to suppress demand for apartments, likely driving rent growth on new leases and renewals lower than it would be in a more robust economic environment. Current elevated supply levels could further affect rent growth for our portfolio, particularly for apartment communities located in urban submarkets.\\u00a0\\u00a0To date, properties in suburban submarkets have been somewhat less impacted by supply, primarily because new development has been less prevalent in those submarkets.\\n\\u00a0\\nMarkets throughout the country have been impacted differently by the pandemic.\\u00a0\\u00a0The individual market economies continue to be at various stages of reopening and we expect them to stay this way for some period. Further, as COVID-19 infections continue to occur in different areas of the country including markets where we operate, we are unable to predict if economies will continue to remain open or if they will be disrupted again in the near future.\\u00a0\\u00a0As we continue to move through this uncertain time, we believe that our portfolio strategy of maintaining a diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and rent price points will serve the company better in this environment than a more concentrated portfolio profile. \\nOur focus during this challenging time has been on working with residents who have been financially impacted by the pandemic on rent payment flexibility. At a portfolio level, we have focused on using our pricing system to maintain strong occupancy. As noted above, average physical occupancy for our Same Store portfolio for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 was 95.7%, which we believe positions us well to manage through the current environment and, hopefully, a further improving economy.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nAccess to the financial markets remains strong, particularly for high credit rated borrowers.\\u00a0\\u00a0We have shown our ability to efficiently raise capital through the debt market since the beginning of the pandemic and believe we could do the same in the equity market as necessary. However, a prolonged disruption of the markets or a decline in credit and financing conditions could negatively affect our ability to access capital necessary to fund our operations or refinance maturing debt.\\nResults of Operations\\nFor the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, we achieved net income available for MAA common shareholders of $46.3 million, a 29.5% increase as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, and total revenue growth of $6.9 million, representing a 1.7% increase in property revenues as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\u00a0\\u00a0The following discussion describes the primary drivers of the increase in net income available for MAA common shareholders for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\nProperty Revenues\\nThe following table reflects our property revenues by segment for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nThree months ended March\\u00a031,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nIncrease\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n%\\u00a0Increase\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nSame Store\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n407,037\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n401,370\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,667\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-Same Store and Other\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n17,968\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n16,728\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1,240\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n7.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n425,005\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n418,098\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n6,907\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1.7\\n\\n%\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nThe increase in property revenues for our Same Store segment for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020 was the primary driver of total property revenue growth.\\u00a0\\u00a0The Same Store segment generated a 1.4% increase in revenues for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, primarily the result of average effective rent per unit growth of 1.3% as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\u00a0\\u00a0The increase in property revenues from the Non-Same Store and Other segment for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 as compared to three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020 was primarily the result of increased revenues from recently completed development properties.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n28\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nProperty Operating Expenses\\nProperty operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other operating expenses.

The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 33 basis points in our effective interest rate during the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\u00a0\\u00a0The decrease in our effective interest rate was primarily due to debt retirements subsequent to the first quarter of 2020 and through March\\u00a031, 2021, which were retired with proceeds from unsecured debt issuances with lower effective interest rates over the same period.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nOther non-operating expense for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 was $15.9 million of expense, a decrease of $12.6 million as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by $15.1 million of non-cash expense related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares during the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, compared to the recognition of $27.6 million of non-cash expense related to the adjustment of the embedded derivative during the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\u00a0\\u00a0During the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, we also recognized $1.6 million of non-cash income from unconsolidated limited partnerships in other non-operating expense compared to $0.1 million of non-cash expense from an unconsolidated limited partnership during the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nFunds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations\\nFunds from operations, or FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents net income available for MAA common shareholders (computed in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding gains or losses on disposition of operating properties and asset impairment, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and adjustments for joint ventures. Because noncontrolling interest is added back, FFO, when used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, represents FFO attributable to the Company.\\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for MAA common shareholders or any other GAAP measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity.\\u00a0Management believes that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance, primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. We believe that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. While our calculation of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts\\u2019, or NAREIT\\u2019s, definition, it may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\\n29\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nCore FFO represents FFO as adjusted for items that are not considered part of our core business operations such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares, gain or loss on sale of non-depreciable assets, adjustments for gains or losses from unconsolidated limited partnerships, net casualty gain or loss, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, non-routine legal costs and settlements, COVID-19 related costs and mark-to-market debt adjustments. While our definition of Core FFO may be similar to others in the industry, our methodology for calculating Core FFO may differ from that utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Core FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. We believe that Core FFO is helpful in understanding our core operating performance between periods in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.\\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income available for MAA common shareholders to FFO and Core FFO for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, as we believe net income available for MAA common shareholders is the most directly comparable GAAP measure (dollars in thousands):\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nThree months ended March\\u00a031,\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2020\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNet income available for MAA common shareholders\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n46,271\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n35,726\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization of real estate assets\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n129,752\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n124,846\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nLoss on sale of depreciable real estate assets\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization of real estate assets\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0 of real estate joint venture\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n155\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n152\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1,671\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n1,304\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nFFO attributable to the Company\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n177,849\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n162,057\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nLoss from embedded derivative in preferred shares(1)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n15,108\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n27,638\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nLoss on sale of non-depreciable real estate assets\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n376\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n(Gain) loss from unconsolidated limited partnerships, net of tax(1)(2)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(1,284\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n77\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nNet casualty loss and other settlement proceeds(3)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n2,355\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n847\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nLoss (gain) on debt extinguishment(1)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(1\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-routine legal costs and settlements(1)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(16\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nCOVID-19 related costs(1)(4)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n310\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n196\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nMark-to-market debt adjustments(5)\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n83\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n(34\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\nCore FFO\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n194,442\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n$\\n\\n191,196\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nIncluded in \\u201cOther non-operating expense\\u201d in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nFor the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, $1.6 million of gains from unconsolidated limited partnerships are offset by $0.3 million of income tax expense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, we incurred $16.9 million in casualty losses related to winter storm Uri (primarily building repairs, landscaping and asset write-offs).\\u00a0 The majority of the storm costs are expected to be reimbursed through insurance coverage.\\u00a0 A receivable has been recognized in \\u201cOther non-operating expense\\u201d for the amount of the recorded losses that we expect to be recovered.\\u00a0 Additional costs related to the storm that are not expected to be recovered through insurance coverage, along with other unrelated casualty losses and recoveries, are reflected in this adjustment.\\u00a0 The adjustment is primarily included in \\u201cOther non-operating expense\\u201d in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. \\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nNon-recurring additional costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting primarily of additional cleaning supplies, contract labor and COVID-19 related leave. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nIncluded in \\u201cInterest expense\\u201d in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\n\\u00a0\\nCore FFO for the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021 was $194.4 million, an increase of $3.2 million as compared to the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2020, primarily as a result of an increase in property revenues of $6.9 million, and decreases in interest expense of $3.8 million and property management expenses of $1.7 million.

Revolving Credit Facility & Commercial Paper\\nIn May 2019, MAALP closed on a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or Wells Fargo, and fourteen other banks, which we refer to as the Credit Facility.\\u00a0\\u00a0The Credit Facility replaced our previous unsecured revolving credit facility and includes an expansion option up to $1.5 billion.\\u00a0\\u00a0The Credit Facility bears an interest rate of LIBOR, plus a spread of 0.75% to 1.45% based on an investment grade pricing grid.\\u00a0\\u00a0The Credit Facility matures in May 2023 with an option to extend for two additional six-month periods.\\u00a0\\u00a0As of March\\u00a031, 2021, there was no outstanding balance under the Credit Facility, while $3.4 million of capacity was used to support outstanding letters of credit.\\u00a0\\u00a0The Credit Facility serves as our primary source of short-term liquidity.\\nIn May 2019, MAALP established an unsecured commercial paper program, whereby it can issue unsecured commercial paper notes with varying maturities not to exceed 397 days up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $500.0 million. As of March\\u00a031, 2021, there was $385.0 million outstanding under the commercial paper program. \\nUnsecured Senior Notes\\nAs of March\\u00a031, 2021, we had $3.7 billion of publicly issued unsecured senior notes and $222.0 million of privately placed unsecured senior notes outstanding.\\nSecured Property Mortgages\\nWe maintain secured property mortgages with various life insurance companies.\\u00a0\\u00a0These mortgages are usually fixed rate and can range from five to 30 years in maturity.\\u00a0\\u00a0As of March\\u00a031, 2021, we had $369.6 million of secured property mortgages with a weighted average interest rate of 4.40%. \\n\\u00a0\\nIn February 2021, we retired a $118.6 million mortgage associated with eight apartment communities prior to its June 2021 maturity.\\n\\u00a0\\nFor more information regarding our debt capital resources, see Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nAs of March\\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, we had an ownership interest in a limited liability company that owns one apartment community comprised of 269 units, located in Washington, D.C.\\u00a0\\u00a0We also had ownership interests in two technology-focused limited partnerships as of March\\u00a031, 2021. Our interests in these investments are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest.\\nAs of March\\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any relationships, including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\\u00a0\\u00a0In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\\u00a0\\u00a0As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.\\u00a0\\u00a0We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\\u00a031, 2020, filed with the SEC on February\\u00a018, 2021.\\nInsurance\\nWe carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our apartment communities, with limits of liability we believe are customary within the multifamily apartment industry, to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We also maintain insurance against the risk of direct physical damage to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild any property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.\\nWe renegotiated our insurance programs effective July\\u00a01, 2020. We believe that the current property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations.\\n33\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nInflation\\nOur resident leases at our apartment communities allow for adjustments in the rental rate at the time of renewal, which may enable us to seek rent increases.\\u00a0\\u00a0The majority of our leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nPlease refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\\u00a031, 2020, filed with the SEC on February\\u00a018, 2021, for discussions of our critical accounting policies.\\u00a0\\u00a0During the three months ended March\\u00a031, 2021, there were no material changes to these policies.\\u00a0\\u00a0For more information on recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material impact on our condensed
