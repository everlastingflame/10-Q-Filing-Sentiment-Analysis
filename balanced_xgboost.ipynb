MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted) The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included herein for Amphenol Corporation (\\\"Amphenol\\\", the \\\"Company\\\", \\\"we\\\", \\\"our\\\", or \\\"us\\\"), which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\\\"U.S. GAAP\\\"). The following discussion and analysis also includes references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined in the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section below, including \\\"Constant Currency Net Sales Growth\\\" and \\\"Organic Net Sales Growth\\\". For purposes of the following discussion, the terms \\\"constant currencies\\\" and \\\"organically\\\" have the same meaning as these aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" within this Item 2 for more information, including our reasons for including the non-GAAP financial measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures. Safe Harbor Statement This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which relate to future, not past, events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements, which address the Company's expected business and financial performance and financial condition, among other matters, may contain words such as: \\\"anticipate,\\\" \\\"could,\\\" \\\"continue,\\\" \\\"expect,\\\" \\\"estimate,\\\" \\\"forecast,\\\" \\\"ongoing,\\\" \\\"project,\\\" \\\"seek,\\\" \\\"predict,\\\" \\\"target,\\\" \\\"will,\\\" \\\"intend,\\\" \\\"plan,\\\" \\\"optimistic,\\\" \\\"potential,\\\" \\\"guidance,\\\" \\\"may,\\\" \\\"should,\\\" or \\\"would\\\" and other words and terms of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about expected earnings, revenues, growth, liquidity or other financial matters. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements, including those with regards to results of operations, liquidity or the Company's effective tax rate and the related impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\\\"Tax Act\\\"), are based upon reasonable assumptions, the expectations may not be attained or there may be material deviation. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following: the Company's dependence on sales to the communications industry, which markets are dominated by large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on suppliers such as the Company; the Company's dependence on sales to the military market, including the impact of reductions or changes in the defense budgets of U.S. and foreign governments; the Company's ability to compete successfully on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time; the Company's ability to continue to conceive, design, source and market new products, as well as market acceptance of the Company's existing and future product lines, for continued revenue growth; the Company's ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, including as a result of significant deterioration of general economic or capital market conditions, or as a result of a downgrade in the Company's credit rating; changes in exchange rates of the various currencies in which the Company conducts business, including possible currency devaluations; changes in interest rates which could impact existing or future issuances of debt; changes in tax laws, regulations and guidance, including related interpretations, in the United States and international jurisdictions, such as the Tax Act; political, economic, military and other risks in countries outside of the United States, including political, economic, financial or other instability, intergovernmental conflicts or actions, strikes or natural disasters; the impact of general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions and U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including those affecting China, on the Company's business operations; difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses as part of the Company's growth strategy, including the potential for the impairment of goodwill; the Company's ability to obtain a consistent supply of materials, at stable pricing levels, used in the Company's manufacturing processes, including aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, certain rare 21 Table of Contents earth metals and plastic resins; litigation or environmental matters including changes to laws and regulations that the Company may be subject to; and cybersecurity threats or incidents that could arise. Such forward-looking statements may also be impacted by, among other things, clarifications to and additional guidance under the Tax Act. More specifically, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted and it significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The provisional income tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 incorporated assumptions made based on the Company's current interpretation of the Tax Act and information then available. The Company continues to obtain, prepare and fully analyze all of the necessary information in order to complete its accounting of the Tax Act, which may require adjustments in 2018 related to this charge. A further description of these uncertainties and other risks can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the Company's other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These or other uncertainties may cause the Company's actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in any forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 On December 22, 2017, the United States federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\\\"Tax Act\\\"), marking a change from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system in the United States. As part of this change, the Tax Act, among other changes, provides for a transition tax on the accumulated unremitted foreign earnings and profits of the Company's foreign subsidiaries (\\\"Transition Tax\\\") and a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an income tax charge of $398.5 (\\\"Tax Act Charge\\\") that was comprised of (i) the Transition Tax of $259.4, (ii) a charge of $176.6 related to changes in the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by (iii) a tax benefit of $37.5 associated with the remeasurement of the Company's U.S. net deferred tax liabilities due to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction. The three components of the Tax Act Charge are provisional amounts recorded in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\\\"SAB 118\\\") (now codified in ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118). SAB 118 addresses the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. Due to the timing of the Tax Act's enactment and the complexity of its provisions, the Company has not completed its accounting for the impact of the Tax Act. The Company continues to analyze guidance and technical interpretations of the provisions of the Tax Act, as well as refine, analyze and update the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare the Tax Act Charge. In accordance with ASU 2018-05, the Company will complete its accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act within the one-year measurement period in 2018, once the Company has obtained, prepared and fully analyzed all the necessary information related to all three components of the Tax Act Charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company did not make any adjustments to the Tax Act Charge during the first quarter of 2018. Results of Operations Three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 Net sales were $1,866.9 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1,560.1 in the first quarter of 2017, which represented an increase of 20% in U.S. dollars, 16% in constant currencies and 12% organically over the same prior year quarter. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) in the first quarter of 2018 increased 21% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 13% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The sales growth was driven by increases in the mobile devices, industrial, automotive, military, and commercial aerospace markets, arising primarily from organic growth along with contributions from the Company's acquisitions. Net sales in both the mobile networks and information technology and data communications markets were relatively flat in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Net sales in the first quarter of 2018 in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband 22 Table of Contents market, were flat in U.S. dollars while decreasing 1% in constant currencies and 1% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017: Percentage Growth (relative to same prior year period) Net sales Foreign Constant Organic growth in currency Currency Net Acquisition Net Sales U.S. Dollars (1) impact (2) Sales Growth (3) impact (4) Growth (3) Three Months Ended March 31: 2018 2017 (GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) (non-GAAP) Net sales: Interconnect Products and Assemblies $ 1,770.0 $ 1,463.5 21 % 4 % 17 % 4 % 13 % Cable Products and Solutions 96.9 96.6 - % 1 % (1) % - % (1) % Consolidated $ 1,866.9 $ 1,560.1 20 % 4 % 16 % 4 % 12 % (1) Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 5 of the accompanying financial statements. (2) Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year period(s) compared to the same period(s) in the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior periods from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior period net sales. (3) Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section. (4) Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company's results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Geographically, sales in the United States in the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately 15% in U.S. dollars ($527.0 in 2018 versus $457.9 in 2017) and 9% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017. International sales in the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately 22% in U.S. dollars ($1,339.9 in 2018 versus $1,102.2 in 2017), 16% in constant currencies and 13% organically, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The comparatively weaker U.S. dollar for the first quarter of 2018 had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $63.4 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $230.0 or 12.3% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $201.8 or 12.9% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. Administrative expenses represented approximately 5.0% of net sales for both the first quarter of 2018 and 2017. Research and development expenses represented approximately 2.8% of net sales for both the first quarter of 2018 and 2017. Selling and marketing expenses represented approximately 4.5% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018 and represented approximately 5.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. Operating income was $376.9 or 20.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $314.1 or 20.1% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for the first quarter of 2018 was $391.1 or 22.1% of net sales compared to $323.9 or 22.1% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. Operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the first quarter of 2018 was $11.3 or 11.7% of net sales compared to $13.7 or 14.2% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in operating margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment for the first quarter of 2018, compared to the first quarter of 2017, was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs. Interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $24.5 compared to $19.3 for the first quarter of 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates associated with the Company's commercial paper borrowings as well as the senior note issuances in April 2017, along with higher average debt levels used to fund the Company's dividend and stock buyback programs. Provision for income taxes for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 were at an effective tax rate of 24.4% and 23.8%, respectively. For the first quarter of 2018, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 110 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.01. 23 Table of Contents For the first quarter of 2017, the excess tax benefits resulting from stock option exercise activity had the impact of lowering the effective tax rate by approximately 270 basis points and increasing earnings per share by $0.02. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section below, for the first three months of 2018 and 2017 was 25.5% and 26.5%, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. Refer to Note 14 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to income taxes. Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (\\\"Diluted EPS\\\") were $265.6 and $0.84, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $224.9 and $0.71, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the effect of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section below within this Item 2, were $261.5 and $0.83, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $216.9 and $0.69, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017. The following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017: Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net Income Net Income attributable Effective attributable Effective Operating Operating to Amphenol Tax Diluted Operating Operating to Amphenol Tax Diluted Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) EPS Income Margin (1) Corporation Rate (1) EPS Reported (GAAP) $ 376.9 20.2 % $ 265.6 24.4 % $ 0.84 $ 314.1 20.1 % $ 224.9 23.8 % $ 0.71 Excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation - - (4.1) 1.1 (0.01) - - (8.0) 2.7 (0.02) Adjusted (non-GAAP) $ 376.9 20.2 % $ 261.5 25.5 % $ 0.83 $ 314.1 20.1 % $ 216.9 26.5 % $ 0.69 (1) While the terms \\\"operating margin\\\" and \\\"effective tax rate\\\" are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure. Liquidity and Capital Resources At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,024.3 and $1,753.7, respectively. The vast majority of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 is located outside of the United States. Historically, we have asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside of the United States. The Tax Act's change to a modified territorial tax system in the United States has significantly reduced the tax expense associated with the remittance of foreign earnings, among other changes. Therefore, the Company recorded a provisional charge for the foreign and U.S. state and local tax cost related to changes in the Company's permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to accumulated unremitted earnings prior to 2018 from certain foreign subsidiaries, due to our intention to repatriate such foreign earnings over time. Such taxes will be paid when those respective earnings are repatriated. As a result of this change, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company has repatriated a significant portion of its foreign cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company intends to continue to repatriate certain foreign earnings generated prior to 2018 throughout the remainder of 2018. The Company also intends to selectively distribute current year earnings for 2018 and beyond from its foreign subsidiaries and will accrue taxes, if any, on those earnings as appropriate. For current year earnings not distributed, the Company intends to treat such earnings as permanently reinvested outside of the United States. The Tax Act also resulted in a Transition Tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, which we will pay, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in annual installments until 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. The Company does not believe that these future tax payments will have a significant impact on its liquidity or capital resources. 24 Table of Contents Cash Flow Summary The following table summarizes the Company's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, as reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow: Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 130.2 $ 237.8 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (142.3) 8.9 Net cash used in financing activities (728.2) (53.7) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 21.4 15.3 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (718.9) $ 208.3 Operating Activities The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company's fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $130.2 in the first three months of 2018 compared to $237.8 in the first three months of 2017. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities (\\\"operating cash flow\\\") for the first three months of 2018 compared to the first three months of 2017 is primarily related to the Company's voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fully fund its U.S. defined benefit pension plans (\\\"U.S. Plans\\\", and together with its foreign plans, the \\\"Plans\\\") as well as a slightly higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital, all of which was partially offset by an increase in net income in the first three months of 2018. In the first three months of 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $133.3, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $99.3 and $65.5, respectively, and an increase in inventories of $55.8, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $118.3. In the first three months of 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $66.8, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to a decrease in accrued expenses of $66.0 and increases in inventories and other current assets of $23.9 and $21.0, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $48.6. The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at March 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. Accounts receivable decreased $82.8 to $1,515.8 primarily due to lower sales in the first quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017, which were partially offset by the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 (\\\"Translation\\\"). Days sales outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 74 and 73 days, respectively. Inventories increased $59.9 to $1,166.8, primarily to support expected future sales levels, as well as the effect of Translation. Inventory days at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were 84 and 76 days, respectively. Other current assets increased $33.4 to $230.2 primarily due to the recording of contract assets of $21.9 in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 as well as an increases in other receivables. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $22.5 to $839.3 primarily due to capital expenditures of $54.9 as well as Translation, partially offset by depreciation of $47.4. Goodwill increased $103.9 to $4,146.5 primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to an acquisition in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment that closed in the first quarter of 2018, as well as Translation. Accounts payable decreased $77.4 to $798.2, primarily as a result of payments on outstanding payables, which more than offset purchasing activity. Payable days at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately 57 and 60 days, respectively. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, decreased $66.1 to $636.6 primarily as a result of decreases in accrued wages and salaries and other employee-related compensation and benefits, partially offset by an increase in accrued income taxes. Accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased $81.5 to $190.5 primarily due to the Company's voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in January 2018 to fully fund the Company's U.S. Plans. 25 Table of Contents The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations and including the first quarter contribution to its U.S. Plans, cash contributions to the Plans will aggregate approximately $90.0 in 2018. The timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance of the Plans' assets. In addition to cash flow from operating activities, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company's ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. As described in more detail above, the decrease in Free Cash Flow is primarily related to the decrease in operating cash flow during the first three months of 2018 which is driven by the voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plans of approximately $81.0 as discussed above, along with an increase in capital expenditures. Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 130.2 $ 237.8 Capital expenditures (GAAP) (54.9) (48.7) Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) $ 75.3 $ 189.1 Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, net sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, and acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities was $142.3 in the first quarter of 2018, while net cash provided by investing activities was $8.9 in the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $99.5 in cash to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $54.1, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $11.3. In the first quarter of 2017, cash provided by investing activities was driven primarily by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $103.9, partially offset by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $48.4 and the funding of acquisitions of $46.6. Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company's credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from stock option exercises, dividend payments and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests. Net cash used in financing activities was $728.2 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $53.7 in the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company's common stock of $382.0, net repayments of long-term debt of $304.8, dividend payments of $58.1 and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $3.9, partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $20.6. For the first quarter of 2017, cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by repurchases of the Company's common stock of $249.2, dividend payments of $49.3, and distributions to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of $4.2, partially offset by increased net borrowings of $225.3 and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $23.7. The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders' equity. The Company's debt financing includes the use of a commercial paper program, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy. The Company has a $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility (the \\\"Revolving Credit Facility\\\"), which matures March 2021 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company intends to utilize the Revolving 26 Table of Contents Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At March 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At March 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the commercial paper program, the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements (the \\\"Commercial Paper Program\\\"). The maximum aggregate principal amount of the commercial paper notes that may be outstanding at any time under the Commercial Paper Program is $2,000.0. Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program are borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The Commercial Paper Program is rated A-2 by Standard & Poor's and P-2 by Moody's and is backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility. The amount of commercial paper notes outstanding as of March 31, 2018 was $869.6. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of commercial paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future. As of March 31, 2018, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the \\\"Senior Notes\\\") as follows: Principal Interest Amount Rate Maturity $ 750.0 2.55 % January 2019 400.0 2.20 % April 2020 375.0 3.125 % September 2021 500.0 4.00 % February 2022 350.0 3.20 % April 2024 The Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company's other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions. The 2.55% Senior Notes are due in January 2019 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2018. Refer to Note 13 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company's debt. On January 24, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company's Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the \\\"2017 Stock Repurchase Program\\\"). During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its common stock for $382.0. These treasury shares have been retired by the Company and common stock and retained earnings were reduced accordingly. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had repurchased approximately 12.6 million shares for $1,000.0 under the previously announced $1,000.0 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, thus completing the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. On April 24, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company's Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the \\\"2018 Stock Repurchase Program\\\"). As of April 30, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock for $55.5 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price. 27 Table of Contents Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock. The following table summarizes the declared quarterly dividends per share as well as the dividends declared and paid for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017: Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Dividends declared per share $ 0.19 $ 0.16 Dividends declared $ 57.4 $ 48.9 Dividends paid (including those declared in the prior year) 58.1 49.3 On April 24, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.19 to $0.23 per share effective with dividends declared in the second quarter of 2018. Liquidity and Cash Requirements The Company's primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Commercial Paper Program, the Revolving Credit Facility, and its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets (including the recent issuances of both the 2020 Senior Notes and 2024 Senior Notes in April 2017) provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future, including the repayment of the $750.0 outstanding principal amount of 2.55% Senior Notes due January 2019 (the \\\"2.55% Notes\\\"). The Company's primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, funding of pension obligations, dividends, debt service (including the repayment of the 2.55% Notes), and payments associated with the Transition Tax which is payable in annual installments until 2025 and taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings. The Company's debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Program. The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. Environmental Matters Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to assessing the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company's financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company's Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company's overall financial performance, trends and period-over-period comparative results, in addition to the reasons noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures related to operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, effective tax rate and diluted EPS exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. Items excluded in such non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs, and certain discrete tax items including but not limited to (i) the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (ii) the Tax Act Charge recorded in 2017 and any subsequent adjustments recorded in 2018 related to this charge. Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact related to foreign currency exchange and acquisitions. 28 Table of Contents The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items. The non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in \\\"Results of Operations\\\" and \\\"Liquidity and Capital Resources\\\" within this Item 2: \\u00b7 Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects, that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined below, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. \\u00b7 Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as Provision for income taxes, as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, expressed as a percentage of Income before income taxes, as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, each excluding the income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. \\u00b7 Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation is defined as Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. \\u00b7 Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating income, as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, excluding income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. \\u00b7 Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income). \\u00b7 Constant Currency Net Sales Growth is defined as the period-over-period percentage change in net sales growth, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Amphenol's results are subject to volatility related to foreign currency translation fluctuations. As such, management evaluates the Company's sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Organic Net Sales Growth (defined below) and Constant Currency Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends. \\u00b7 Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities (\\\"operating cash flow\\\" - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), both of which are derived from the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to shareholders through either stock repurchases or dividends. \\u00b7 Organic Net Sales Growth is defined as the period-over-period percentage change in net sales growth resulting from operating volume and pricing changes, and excludes the impact of 1) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which directly impact the Company's operating results and are outside the control of the Company and 2) acquisitions closed during the periods presented, which were not included in the Company's results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Management evaluates the Company's sales performance based on actual sales growth 29 Table of Contents in U.S. dollars, as well as Constant Currency Net Sales Growth (defined above) and Organic Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends.

This is followed by a discussion of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then discuss our Results of Operations for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, followed by an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and discuss our financial commitments in the section titled \\\"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\\\" Business and Macroeconomic EnvironmentIn the first half of calendar 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic initially resulted in a global disruption in economic activity by adversely affecting production, creating supply chain and market disruption, and adversely impacting businesses and individuals. However, in the second half of fiscal 2021, business conditions were unexpectedly strong as businesses and individuals adapted to the effects of the pandemic. In response to global supply constraints, we worked to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business by qualifying alternative suppliers, increasing our inventory of raw materials, ramping our internal factories and adding assembly and test capacity to increase our manufacturing capability while securing additional capacity with our subcontractors wherever possible. Strong customer demand for our products continued to outpace capacity in the first half of fiscal 2023 and in fiscal 2022. While our business remained strong in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, our overall business in China, which is one of our key markets, was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 lock-downs and the subsequent rapid transmission of COVID-19 when lock-downs in China were lifted. In addition, rising interest rates and high inflation in the U.S. may result in a slowdown in the global economy and reduce customer demand in our industry. We are unable to predict the timing or impact of any such slowdown on our business. Despite supply gradually improving in recent quarters, and more improvement expected in the coming quarters, we expect that certain supply chain constraints will persist through much of calendar 2023; however, recent uncertainty in the U.S. and world economies may lessen the impact of such constraints on our business in future periods. In order to provide prioritized capacity to our customers, we launched our Preferred Supply Program in February 2021, which provides our customers with prioritized capacity beginning six months after the customer places an order for 12 months of continuous, non-cancellable and non-reschedulable backlog. Since the first quarter of calendar 2022, we have been entering into certain long-term supply agreements with our customers for products that will be shipped in future periods. We also entered into certain long-term supply agreements with key suppliers. In response to the pandemic, we have taken proactive preventative measures to enable a safe environment for our employees and operation of our manufacturing sites. While our global manufacturing sites have been fully operational in recent periods, we strategically implemented plans intended to provide more assurance of business continuity in the event severe outbreaks or government requirements were to impact our operations.Strategy We develop, manufacture and sell smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions used by our customers for a wide variety of applications. Our strategic focus includes general purpose and specialized 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers, microprocessors, analog, FPGA, and memory products. With over 30 years of technology leadership, our broad product portfolio is a Total System Solution (TSS) for our customers that can provide a large portion of the silicon requirements in their applications. TSS is a combination of hardware, software and services which help our customers increase their revenue, reduce their costs and manage their risks compared to other solutions. Our synergistic product portfolio empowers disruptive growth trends, including 5G, data centers, sustainability, Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving, and electric vehicles, in key end markets such as automotive, aerospace and defense, communications, consumer appliances, data centers and computing, and industrial.26Table of ContentsOur manufacturing operations include wafer fabrication, wafer probe, assembly and test. The ownership of a substantial portion of our manufacturing resources is an important component of our business strategy, enabling us to maintain a high level of manufacturing control, resulting in us being one of the lowest cost producers in the embedded control industry. By owning wafer fabrication facilities and our assembly and test operations, and by employing statistical techniques (statistical process control, designed experiments and wafer level monitoring), we have been able to achieve and maintain high production yields. Direct control over manufacturing resources allows us to shorten our design and production cycles. This control also allows us to capture a portion of the wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing profit margin. We outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing requirements to third parties and the amount of our outsourced manufacturing has increased in recent years due to our acquisitions of Microsemi and other companies that outsourced all or substantial portions of their manufacturing. Although we recently considered building a 300 mm U.S. based wafer fabrication facility for specialized, trailing edge process technologies, we have concluded that our business objectives could likely be better achieved through relationships with our foundry suppliers.We employ proprietary design and manufacturing processes in developing our embedded control products. We believe our processes afford us both cost-effective designs in existing and derivative products and greater functionality in new product designs. While many of our competitors develop and optimize separate processes for their logic and memory product lines, we use a common process technology for both microcontroller and non-volatile memory products. This allows us to more fully leverage our process research and development costs and to deliver new products to market more rapidly. Our engineers utilize advanced computer-aided design tools and software to perform circuit design, simulation and layout, and our in-house photomask and wafer fabrication facilities enable us to rapidly verify design techniques by processing test wafers quickly and efficiently. We are committed to continuing our investment in new and enhanced products, including development systems, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies. We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position. Our current research and development activities focus on the design of new microcontrollers, digital signal controllers, memory, analog and mixed-signal products, FPGAs, timing systems, Flash-IP, development systems, software and application-specific software libraries. We are also developing new design and process technologies to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements in our products. We market and sell our products worldwide primarily through a network of direct sales personnel and distributors. Our direct sales force focuses on a wide variety of strategic accounts in three geographical markets: the Americas, Europe and Asia. We currently maintain sales and technical support centers in major metropolitan areas in all three geographic markets. We believe that a strong technical service presence is essential to the continued development of the embedded control market. Many of our CEMs, ESEs, and sales managers have technical degrees or backgrounds and have been previously employed in high technology environments. We believe that the technical and business knowledge of our sales force is a key competitive advantage in the sale of our products. The primary mission of our ESE team is to provide technical assistance to customers and to conduct periodic training sessions for the balance of our sales team. ESEs also frequently conduct technical seminars and workshops in major cities around the world or through online webcasts. Our licensing division has dedicated sales, technology, design, product, test and reliability personnel that support the requirements of our licensees. See the risk factor captioned \\\"Our operating results are impacted by seasonality and wide fluctuations of supply and demand in the industry\\\" on page 43 for discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Except for the changes discussed in \\\"Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\\" in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, there were no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the first nine months of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 compared to our \\\"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\\" as previously described in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. 27Table of ContentsResults of Operations The following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the periods covered by this report:Three Months Ended December 31,Nine Months Ended December 31,2022202120222021Net sales100.0 %100.0 %100.0 %100.0 %Cost of sales32.2 34.4 32.7 35.1 Gross profit67.8 65.6 67.3 64.9 Research and development13.0 14.0 13.2 14.7 Selling, general and administrative9.4 10.1 9.6 10.7 Amortization of acquired intangible assets7.7 12.2 8.1 13.0 Special charges (income) and other, net0.3 - (0.1)0.4 Operating income37.4 %29.3 %36.5 %26.1 %Net Sales We operate in two industry segments and engage primarily in the design, development, manufacture and sale of semiconductor products as well as the licensing of our SuperFlash and other technologies. We sell our products to distributors and OEMs in a broad range of markets, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral. In certain circumstances, a customer's financial condition may require collateral, and, in such cases, the collateral would be typically provided in the form of letters of credit.The following table summarizes our net sales for the periods covered by this report (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 31,Nine Months Ended December 31,20222021Change20222021ChangeNet sales$2,169.2 $1,757.5 23.4 %$6,206.0 $4,976.7 24.7 %The increases in net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 were primarily due to strong business conditions that began in the second half of fiscal 2021 as businesses and individuals adapted to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Business conditions continued to be strong in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 although there is increased uncertainty as to the future direction of the global economy due to rising interest rates and high inflation. Additionally, semiconductor industry conditions have resulted in increased costs throughout our supply chain, which we have been passing on to our customers in the form of price increases. Our price increases were implemented at various times and in various amounts throughout fiscal 2022 with respect to our very broad range of customers and products. These price increases also contributed to the increase in net sales during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. Due to the complexity of the implementation of the price increases and the changes in product, geographic and customer mix, we are not able to quantify the impact of the price increases on our net sales. Additionally, the increase in net sales was positively impacted by strength in all of our product lines. See our \\\"Business and Macroeconomic Environment\\\" discussion above for further information on our business outlook. Other factors that we believe contributed to changes in our reported net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 and which are drivers of long-term trends in our net sales but which factors we are not able to quantify include:semiconductor industry conditions;our various new product offerings that have increased our served available market;customers' increasing needs for the flexibility offered by our programmable solutions; andincreasing semiconductor content in our customers' products through our Total Systems Solutions.We sell a large number of products to a large and diverse customer base and there was not any single product or customer that accounted for a material portion of the change in our net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 or the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. 28Table of ContentsNet sales by product line for the periods covered by this report were as follows (dollars in millions): Three Months Ended December 31,Nine Months Ended December 31,2022%2021%2022%2021%Microcontrollers$1,221.3 56.3 $972.2 55.3 $3,463.8 55.9 $2,768.7 55.6 Analog606.5 28.0 500.5 28.5 1,759.0 28.3 1,423.5 28.6 Other341.4 15.7 284.8 16.2 983.2 15.8 784.5 15.8 Total net sales$2,169.2 100.0 $1,757.5 100.0 $6,206.0 100.0 $4,976.7 100.0 Microcontrollers Our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales. Microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately 56.3% and 55.9% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately 55.3% and 55.6% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Net sales of our microcontroller products increased 25.6% and 25.1% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. These sales increases were due primarily to strength in demand for our microcontroller products in end markets that we serve and our price increases. Historically, average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product. However, the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have increased in recent periods and have remained relatively stable over time due to the proprietary nature of these products. We have in the past been able to, and expect in the future to be able to, moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices. Analog Our analog product line includes analog, interface, mixed signal and timing products. Our analog product line accounted for approximately 28.0% and 28.3% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately 28.5% and 28.6% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.Net sales from our analog product line increased 21.2% and 23.6% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to strength in demand for our analog products in end markets that we serve and our price increases. We consider a majority of the products in our analog product line to be proprietary in nature, where prices are relatively stable, similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products. The non-proprietary portion of our analog product line will experience price fluctuations, driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products. Other Our other product line includes FPGA products, royalties associated with licenses for the use of our SuperFlash and other technologies, sales of our intellectual property, fees for engineering services, memory products, timing systems, manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting), legacy application specific integrated circuits, and certain products for aerospace applications. Revenue from these services and products accounted for approximately 15.7% and 15.8% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately 16.2% and 15.8% of our net sales for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. Net sales related to these services and products increased 19.9% and 25.3% in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. The increases in net sales were primarily due to strength in demand for our products in end markets that we serve and our price increases. Net sales of our other product line can fluctuate over time based on general economic and semiconductor industry conditions as well as changes in demand for our FPGA products, licenses, engineering services, memory products, timing systems, and manufacturing services (wafer foundry and assembly and test subcontracting). 29Table of ContentsDistribution Distributors accounted for approximately 48% and 47% of our net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and approximately 45% and 48% of our net sales in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The lower distribution percentages in the second half fiscal 2022 and the first half of fiscal 2023 were due to lower Preferred Supply Program participation among our distributors. With the exception of Arrow Electronics, our largest distributor, which made up 10% of our net sales, no other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in the nine months ended December 31, 2022. In the nine months ended December 31, 2021, no distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales. Our distributors focus primarily on servicing the product requirements of a broad base of diverse customers. We believe that distributors provide an effective means of reaching this broad and diverse customer base. We believe that customers recognize Microchip for its products and brand name and use distributors as an effective supply channel.Generally, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and we, or our distributors, may terminate our relationships with each other with little or no advance notice, with the exception of orders placed under our Preferred Supply Program or otherwise designated as non-cancellable. The loss of, or the disruption in the operations of, one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns. At December 31, 2022, our distributors maintained 22 days of inventory of our products compared to 17 days at March 31, 2022. Over the past ten fiscal years, the days of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately 17 days and 40 days. Inventory holding patterns at our distributors may have a material impact on our net sales. Sales by Geography Sales by geography for the periods covered by this report were as follows (dollars in millions):Three Months Ended December 31,Nine Months Ended December 31,2022%2021%2022%2021%Americas$567.4 26.2 $439.3 25.0 $1,588.7 25.6 $1,232.2 24.8 Europe428.6 19.8 360.4 20.5 1,242.0 20.0 994.7 20.0 Asia1,173.2 54.0 957.8 54.5 3,375.3 54.4 2,749.8 55.2 Total net sales$2,169.2 100.0 $1,757.5 100.0 $6,206.0 100.0 $4,976.7 100.0 Americas sales include sales to customers in the U.S., Canada, Central America and South America. Sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately 77% of our total net sales in each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to approximately 78% of our total net sales in each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. Substantially all of our foreign sales are U.S. dollar denominated. Our sales force in the Americas and Europe supports a significant portion of the design activity for products which are ultimately shipped to Asia. Gross Profit Our gross profit in the three months ended December 31, 2022 was $1.47 billion, or 67.8% of net sales, compared to $1.15 billion, or 65.6% of net sales, in the three months ended December 31, 2021. Our gross profit in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $4.18 billion, or 67.3% of net sales, compared to $3.23 billion, or 64.9% of net sales, in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin increased in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021 primarily as a result of higher utilization of our factories due to increased customer demand.Our overall inventory levels were $1.17 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $854.4 million at March 31, 2022. We maintained 152 days of inventory on our balance sheet at December 31, 2022 compared to 125 days of inventory at March 31, 2022. Inventory increased primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Our inventory levels are impacted by the timing of receipt of raw materials, foundry wafers, and strategic last time buy materials and completion of finished goods. We expect our days of inventory levels at March 31, 2023 to be 157 to 164 days. We operate assembly and test facilities in Thailand, the Philippines, and other locations throughout the world. Approximately 59% of our assembly requirements were performed in our internal assembly facilities during each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Approximately 68% and 67% of our test requirements 30Table of Contentswere performed in our internal test facilities during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately 63% and 64% during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The percentage of our assembly and test operations that are performed internally fluctuates over time based on supply and demand conditions in the semiconductor industry, our internal capacity capabilities and our acquisition activities. We believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our internal facilities provide us with significant cost savings compared to third party contractor assembly and test costs, as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process. We plan to continue to invest in assembly and test equipment to increase our internal capacity capabilities and transition certain outsourced assembly and test capacity to our internal facilities.We rely on outside wafer foundries for a significant portion of our wafer fabrication requirements. Approximately 63% of our net sales came from products that were produced at outside wafer foundries during each of the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, compared to approximately 61% and 60% during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.Research and DevelopmentR&D expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $282.4 million, or 13.0% of net sales, compared to $245.4 million, or 14.0% of net sales, for the three months ended December 31, 2021. R&D expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $820.0 million, or 13.2% of net sales, compared to $730.0 million, or 14.7% of net sales, for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. We are committed to investing in new and enhanced products, including development systems software, and in our design and manufacturing process technologies. We believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position. R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Assets purchased to support our ongoing research and development activities are capitalized when related to products which have achieved technological feasibility or that have alternative future uses and are amortized over their expected useful lives. R&D expenses include labor, depreciation, masks, prototype wafers, and expenses for the development of process technologies, new packages, and software to support new products and design environments.R&D expenses increased $37.0 million, or 15.1%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 over the same period last year. R&D expenses increased $90.0 million, or 12.3%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 over the same period last year. The primary reasons for the increases in R&D costs were increases in headcount and employee compensation as well as higher product development costs. R&D expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.Selling, General and AdministrativeSelling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were $202.9 million, or 9.4% of net sales, compared to $177.5 million, or 10.1% of net sales, for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $594.2 million, or 9.6% of net sales, compared to $531.7 million, or 10.7% of net sales, for the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Our goal is to continue to be more efficient with our selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales, marketing and administrative personnel, advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses as well as costs related to our direct sales force, CEMs and ESEs who work remotely from sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $25.4 million, or 14.3%, for the three months ended December 31, 2022 over the same period last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $62.5 million, or 11.8%, for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 over the same period last year. The primary reasons for the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were increases in headcount and employee compensation.Selling, general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to revenue and operating expense investment levels.Amortization of Acquired Intangible AssetsAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $167.4 million and $502.5 million, respectively, compared to $215.7 million and $647.0 million for the three and nine months ended 31Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2021, respectively. The primary reason for the decreases in acquired intangible asset amortization was due to the use of accelerated amortization methods for assets placed in service in previous fiscal years.Special Charges (Income) and Other, Net During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred special charges and other, net of $6.5 million and earned special income and other, net of $6.1 million, respectively. The special charges and other, net incurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to restructuring of acquired and existing wafer fabrication operations to increase operational efficiency. The special income and other, net earned during the nine months ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to a favorable resolution of a previously accrued legal matter partially offset by restructuring costs of acquired and existing wafer fabrication operations to increase operational efficiency. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, we earned special income and other, net of $0.3 million and incurred special charges and other, net of $20.4 million, respectively. The special income and other, net earned during the three months ended December 31, 2021, and the special charges and other, net incurred during the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily related to restructuring of acquired and existing wafer fabrication operations to increase operational efficiency, legal contingencies and exiting non-manufacturing facilities including contract termination costs, employee severance, and the disposal of assets.Other Income (Expense)Interest income in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $0.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively, compared to $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021.Interest expense in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022 was $52.8 million and $156.4 million, respectively, compared to $62.1 million and $199.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021. The primary reasons for the decreases in interest expense relates to the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on April 1, 2022, which eliminated the amortization of debt discount on our Convertible Debt, and the cumulative pay down of our debt offset by higher interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt.During the nine months ended December 31, 2022, we recognized losses of $8.3 million related to the settlement of a portion of our outstanding 2015 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, and our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, we recognized losses of $16.1 million and $101.6 million, respectively, related to the settlement of a portion of our outstanding 2015 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, and our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt as well as the amendment and restatement of our Credit Agreement and the repayment of $1.00 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 3.922% 2021 Notes.Other income, net was $2.6 million and $3.5 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, compared to $4.6 million and $3.5 million for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2021, respectively.Provision for Income TaxesOur provision for income taxes is attributable to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, increased significantly over the same period last year primarily due to a provision in the TCJA. Research and development expenditures incurred after March 31, 2022, must be capitalized and amortized ratably over five or fifteen years for tax purposes, depending on the location in which the research activities are conducted. The resulting capitalization of research and development expenditures impacts the calculation of our GILTI, which is treated as a period cost, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions in which we have operations. The effective tax rates that we pay in these jurisdictions vary widely, but they are generally lower than our combined U.S. federal and state effective tax rate. Our domestic blended statutory tax rate in each of the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 was approximately 22%. Our non-U.S. blended statutory tax rates in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were lower than this amount. The difference in rates applicable in foreign jurisdictions results from a number of factors, including lower statutory rates, tax holidays, financing arrangements and other factors. Our effective tax rate has been and will continue to be impacted by the geographical dispersion of our earnings and losses.Our foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to our operations and assets in Thailand, Malta, and Ireland. Our Thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to us based on our investment in 32Table of Contentsproperty, plant, and equipment in Thailand. Our tax holiday periods in Thailand expire at various times in the future; however, we actively seek to obtain new tax holidays, otherwise we will be subject to tax at the statutory tax rate of 20%. We do not expect the future expiration of any of our tax holiday periods in Thailand to have a material impact on our effective tax rate. The remaining material components of foreign income taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. are earnings accrued in Ireland at a 12.5% statutory tax rate and earnings accrued in Malta at a 5.0% statutory tax rate.In September 2021, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2012. The disputed amounts largely relate to transfer pricing matters. We firmly believe that the assessments are without merit and plan to pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to resolve this matter. In December 2021, we filed a petition in the United States Tax Court challenging the Notice. We intend to vigorously defend our position and we are confident in our ability to prevail on the merits. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations such as this to determine the adequacy of our tax reserves. We believe that the final adjudication of this matter will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows and that we have adequate tax reserves for all tax matters. However, the ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the IRS were to prevail on all of its assertions, the assessed tax, penalties, and deficiency interest could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Various taxing authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of the tax structures employed by businesses. Companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations. For U.S. federal, and in general for U.S. state tax returns, our fiscal 2007 and later tax returns remain effectively open for examination by the taxing authorities. We are currently being audited by the tax authorities in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. At this time, we do not know what the outcome of these audits will be. We record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on their technical merits under currently enacted law. If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, we recognize the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Inflation Reduction Act) into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (Corporate AMT) of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.00 billion over a three-year period. The Corporate AMT is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2024. We are evaluating the Corporate AMT and its potential impact on our future U.S. tax expense, cash taxes, and effective tax rate. 33Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources We had $288.9 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $30.5 million from the March 31, 2022 balance. Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.91 billion in the nine months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher net income of $1.63 billion, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $1.09 billion and net cash inflows of $190.3 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 include an increase in trade accounts receivable driven primarily by higher net sales and an increase in inventories related to increased raw materials, foundry wafers, finished goods, and receipt of strategic last time buy materials, offset by increases in accrued and other liabilities driven by higher sales related reserves, including cash collected from customers under our long-term supply agreements. The cash collected from these long-term supply agreements is refundable when customers fulfill their purchase commitments. In future periods, we expect cash inflows under these arrangements to decrease, and cash outflows to increase as amounts are refunded to customers (see \\\"Note 4. Net Sales\\\" to our condensed consolidated financial statements). Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.10 billion in the nine months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to net income of $847.6 million, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $1.16 billion and net cash inflows of $91.6 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $448.7 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $335.0 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. During the nine months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, net investing activities primarily related to capital purchases and investments in other assets. Our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions. Capital expenditures in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 were $373.5 million compared to $255.5 million in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment. We currently expect to invest between $400 million and $500 million in equipment and facilities during the next twelve months. We believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next twelve months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our production capabilities for our new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of our production requirements that are currently outsourced. We expect to finance our capital expenditures through our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations. In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the CHIPS Act which is to provide billions of dollars of cash incentives and a new investment tax credit to increase domestic manufacturing capacity in our industry. Such incentives may potentially be available to us, our competitors and foundries; however, there can be no assurance that we will receive any such incentives, what the amount and timing of any incentive we receive will be, as to which other companies will receive incentives and whether the legislation will have a positive or negative impact on our competitive position. Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $2.49 billion in the nine months ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1.73 billion in the nine months ended December 31, 2021. Significant transactions affecting our net financing cash flows included:in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, $1.32 billion of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt, including our 2015 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt, and our Revolving Credit Facility, andin the first nine months of fiscal 2022, $1.17 billion of cash used to pay down certain principal of our debt, including the cash portion of the settlement of our 2015 Senior Convertible Debt, our 2017 Senior Convertible Debt and our 2017 Junior Convertible Debt, our Revolving Credit Facility and our 3.922% 2021 Notes, partially funded by the issuance of our senior notes, andin the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we paid cash dividends to our stockholders of $499.4 million and $363.0 million, respectively, andin the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we repurchased shares of our common stock for $671.9 million and $166.0 million, respectively. In December 2021, we amended and restated our Credit Agreement in its entirety. The amended and restated Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility up to $2.75 billion that terminates on December 16, 2026. The 34Table of ContentsCredit Agreement also permits us, subject to certain conditions, to add one or more incremental term loan facilities or increase the revolving loan commitments up to $750.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was $6.62 billion. At December 31, 2022, we had $253.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility compared to $1.40 billion at March 31, 2022.Capital ReturnsIn November 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.00 billion of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In the first nine months of fiscal 2023, we repurchased approximately 9.6 million shares of our common stock for $671.9 million under this authorization. In the first nine months of fiscal 2022, we repurchased approximately 2.0 million shares of our common stock for $166.0 million under this authorization. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $2.90 billion remained available for repurchases under the program. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 30.0 million shares as treasury shares. Our current intent is to regularly repurchase shares of our common stock over time based on our cash generation, leverage metrics, and market conditions.In October 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. To date, our cumulative dividend payments have totaled approximately $5.55 billion. A quarterly cash dividend of $0.328 per share was paid on December 6, 2022 in the aggregate amount of $180.3 million. A quarterly dividend of $0.358 per share was declared on February 2, 2023 and will be paid on March 7, 2023 to stockholders of record as of February 21, 2023. We expect the aggregate cash dividend for the March 2023 quarter to be approximately $196.0 million. Our Board is free to change our dividend practices at any time and to increase or decrease the dividend paid, or not to pay a dividend on our common stock on the basis of our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. Our current intent is to increase our quarterly cash dividends depending upon market conditions, our results of operations, and potential changes in tax laws.We believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from working capital requirements, interest and principal repayments related to our outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, cash dividends, share repurchases, and income tax payments. For additional information regarding our cash requirements see \\\"Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies\\\", \\\"Note 7. Debt\\\" and \\\"Note 12. Income Taxes\\\" to our condensed consolidated financial statements. The semiconductor industry is capital intensive and in order to remain competitive, we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development and to expand our existing facilities or potentially construct new facilities. We may increase our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities, for cash dividends, for share repurchases or for acquisitions or other purposes. The timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, including our level of dividend payments, changes in tax laws and regulations regarding the repatriation of offshore cash, demand for our products, changes in industry conditions, product mix, competitive factors and our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates. We may from time to time seek to refinance certain of our outstanding notes or Convertible Debt through issuances of new notes or convertible debt, tender offers, exchange transactions or open market repurchases. Such issuances, tender offers or exchanges or purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, our liquidity position and other factors. There can be no assurance that any financing will be available on acceptable terms due to uncertainties resulting from rising interest rates, higher inflation, economic uncertainty, the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders. We also plan to pursue incentives under the CHIPS Act to increase our domestic manufacturing capacity; however, there can be no assurance that we will receive any such incentives or what the amount and timing of any incentive we receive will be.\",\n          \"Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsBUSINESS OVERVIEWWe are a global premier systems provider of high technology products and services to the aerospace and defense industries. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms \\\"we,\\\" \\\"our,\\\" \\\"us,\\\" \\\"the Company,\\\" and \\\"RTX\\\" mean RTX Corporation and its subsidiaries. Raytheon follows a 4-4-5 fiscal calendar while Collins Aerospace (Collins) and Pratt & Whitney use a quarter calendar end. Throughout this Form 10-Q, when we refer to the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 with respect to Raytheon, we are referring to their September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 fiscal quarter ends, respectively. The current status of significant factors affecting our business environment in 2024 is discussed below. For additional discussion, refer to the \\\"Business Overview\\\" section in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Industry ConsiderationsOur worldwide operations can be affected by industrial, economic, and political factors on both a regional and global level. Our operations include original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and extensive related aftermarket parts and services related to our aerospace operations. Our defense business serves both domestic and international customers primarily as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for government customers. Our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycles in our commercial aerospace spares contracts and certain service contracts in our defense business, and longer cycles in our aerospace OEM and aftermarket maintenance contracts and on our defense contracts to design, develop, manufacture, or modify complex equipment. Our customers are in the public and private sectors, and our businesses reflect an extensive geographic diversification that has evolved with continued globalization. Government legislation, policies, and regulations can impact our business and operations. Changes in environmental and climate change-related laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, and energy taxes, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and facility upgrades and could increase our operational and environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes. In addition, government and industry-driven safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions, government imposed travel restrictions, and government procurement practices can impact our businesses.Collins and Pratt & Whitney serve both commercial and government aerospace customers. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs), available seat miles, and the general economic health of airline carriers and airframers are key barometers for our commercial aerospace operations. In particular, the ongoing work stoppages at a major airframer customer, may adversely impact our business. Performance in the general aviation sector is closely tied to the overall health of the economy and is positively correlated to corporate profits. Many of our aerospace customers are covered under long-term aftermarket service agreements at both Collins and Pratt & Whitney, which are inclusive of both spare parts and services.Our defense operations are affected by U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budget and spending levels, changes in demand, changes in policy positions or priorities, the domestic and global political and economic environment, and the evolving nature of the global and national security threat environment. In addition, our defense businesses engage in both direct commercial sales, which generally require U.S. government licenses and approvals, as well as foreign military sales, which are government-to-government transactions initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the U.S. government. Changes in these budget and spending levels, policies, or priorities, which are subject to U.S. domestic and foreign geopolitical risks and threats, may impact our defense businesses, including the timing of and delays in U.S. government licenses and approvals for sales, the risk of sanctions, or other restrictions. Refer to \\\"U.S. Government's Continuing Resolution\\\" below for additional information. Other MattersGlobal, economic, and political conditions, changes in raw material and commodity prices and supply, labor availability and costs, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical conflicts and strained intercountry relations, U.S. and non-U.S. tax law changes, foreign currency exchange rates, energy costs and supply, levels of air travel, the financial condition of commercial airlines, and the impact from natural disasters and weather conditions create uncertainties that could impact our businesses. Legal Matters. The Company has resolved several outstanding legal matters, herein referred to as \\\"Resolution of Certain Legal Matters.\\\" The Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Company settled an administrative proceeding with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), in connection with certain Middle East contracts since 2012 (Thales-Raytheon Systems and 32Table of ContentsRelated Matters). The Company also entered into a DPA and a False Claims Act (FCA) settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017 (DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes). In addition, the Company resolved certain voluntarily disclosed export controls violations primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser extent, Raytheon Company, including certain violations that were resolved pursuant to a consent agreement with the Department of State (DOS) (Trade Compliance Matters). As a result, we recorded a combined pre-tax charge of $918 million during the second quarter of 2024, which included an accrual of $269 million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes (in addition to amounts previously accrued), an accrual of $364 million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters (in addition to amounts previously accrued), and an accrual of $285 million related to Trade Compliance Matters. See \\\"Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies\\\" within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information.Pratt & Whitney Powder Metal Matter. As described further in \\\"Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies,\\\" within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, in 2023, Pratt & Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100G-JM (PW1100) Geared Turbofan (GTF) fleet, which powers the A320neo family of aircraft (A320neo) (herein referred to as the \\\"Powder Metal Matter\\\").Global Supply Chain. We are dependent on a global supply chain and in recent years have experienced supply chain disruptions that resulted in delays and increased costs which adversely affected our performance. These disruptions impacted our ability to procure raw materials, microelectronics, and certain commodities on a timely basis and/or at expected prices, and have been driven by supply chain market constraints and macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and labor market shortages. Current geopolitical conditions, including conflicts and other causes of strained intercountry relations, as well as sanctions and other trade restrictive activities, continue to contribute to these issues. Furthermore, our suppliers and subcontractors have been impacted by these same issues. As a result of the Canadian government's imposition of sanctions in February 2024, including those imposed on U.S.- and German-based Russian-owned entities from which we source titanium for use in our Canadian operations, we recorded charges of $175 million in the first quarter of 2024 within our Collins segment. These charges are primarily related to the recognition of unfavorable purchase commitments and an impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable as a result of initiating alternative titanium sources. We have implemented actions and programs to mitigate some of the impacts but anticipate supply chain disruptions to continue.Economic Environment. High inflation levels have increased material and component prices, labor rates, and supplier costs and have negatively impacted our operating profit and margin, including the impact on productivity expectations. Due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace businesses, and their respective customer and supplier contracts, we are not always able to offset cost increases by increasing our contract value or pricing, in particular on our fixed-price contracts. Increasing material, component, and labor prices could subject us to losses in our fixed price contracts in the event of cost overruns. In addition, higher interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and tightened the availability of capital. Among other things, these effects can constrain our customers' purchasing power and decrease orders for our products and services and impact the ability of our customers to make payments and of our suppliers to perform. Moreover, volatility in interest rates and financial markets can lead to economic uncertainty, an economic downturn or recession and impact the demand for our products and services as well as our supply chain. We continue to pursue strategic and operational initiatives to help address these macroeconomic pressures, including our digital transformation, operational modernization, cost reduction, and advanced technology programs, and we apply our Customer Oriented Results Excellence (CORE) operating platform to the execution of these initiatives. However, the impact of these pressures and corresponding initiatives is uncertain and subject to a range of factors and future developments.U.S. Government's Continuing Resolution. On September 26, 2024, President Biden signed a continuing resolution that funds federal agencies through December 20, 2024. A continuing resolution authorizes federal agencies to operate generally at the same funding levels from the prior year, but typically does not authorize new spending initiatives during this period. If Congress is unable to enact formal fiscal year 2025 appropriation bills by December 20, 2024, it may pass another continuing resolution. However, if Congress fails to pass the formal appropriations bills or a continuing resolution, then the U.S. government would shut down during which federal agencies would cease all non-essential functions.In the event of a U.S. government shutdown, our business, program performance and results of operations could be impacted by the resulting disruptions to federal government offices, workers, and operations, including risks relating to the funding of certain programs, stop work orders, as well as delays in contract awards, new program starts, payments for work performed, and other actions. We also may experience similar impacts in the event of an extended period of continuing resolutions. Generally, the significance of these impacts will primarily be based on the length of the continuing resolution or shutdown. Furthermore, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which imposes limits on discretionary spending for defense and non-defense programs in exchange for the lifting of the debt ceiling in June 2023, if Congress fails to enact appropriation bills by April 30, 33Table of Contents2025, then the budget caps will be reduced and corresponding automatic reductions to agency budget accounts will be enforced through sequestration.Geopolitical Matters. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company's management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software, and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers, including as discussed above in Global Supply Chain; however, based on information available to date, we do not currently expect these issues will have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We will continue to monitor future developments, including additional sanctions and other measures, that could adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers.In February 2023, China announced sanctions against Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD) (a former RTX Corporation (RTX) business segment which became part of Raytheon during the third quarter of 2023), and previously announced it may take measures against RTX, in connection with certain foreign military sales to Taiwan. The Chinese sanctions against RMD included a fine equal to twice the value of the arms that RMD sold to Taiwan since September 2020. In addition, in September 2022, China indicated that it decided to sanction our Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Gregory Hayes, in connection with another foreign military sale to Taiwan involving RTX products and services. In January 2024, China announced sanctions against Data Link Solutions LLC, a Collins joint venture and, most recently, in May 2024, China announced sanctions against Raytheon Missile Systems and the Javelin Joint Venture between Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. If China were to impose additional sanctions, enforce announced sanctions, or take other regulatory action against RTX, our suppliers, affiliates, or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. Any impact of these or other potential sanctions or other actions by China is uncertain.We have direct commercial sales contracts for products and services to certain foreign customers, for which U.S. government review and approval has been pending. The U.S. government's approval of these sales is subject to a range of factors, including its foreign policies related to these customers, which are subject to continuing review and potential changes. Likewise, regulatory approvals previously granted for prior sales can be paused or revoked if the products and services have not yet been delivered to the customer. In addition, certain programs require approvals by foreign governments, and those approvals may not be obtained on a timely basis or at all or may be revoked. If we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approvals, or those approvals are revoked, it could have a material effect on our financial results. In particular, during the third quarter of 2024, we received a critical license required to restart work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer. In order to perform under these contracts, significant actions are required, including obtaining additional regulatory approvals, and therefore we have not recognized revenue on these contracts to date. Should the remaining uncertainties be resolved, we do not expect these contracts to have a significant impact on our future financial results. As of September 30, 2024, our Contract liabilities include approximately $430 million of advance payments received in connection with these contracts, which may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated.We continue to closely monitor potential impacts from the war in Gaza and the recent escalation of conflict in the region on RTX's business, customers, suppliers, employees, and operations in Israel, the Middle East, and elsewhere. To date, the impacts to RTX have been minimal, though a number of countries have imposed restrictions on exports to or imports from Israel. RTX's commercial manufacturing facilities in Israel remain open and operational and have continued exporting products and importing critical items and raw materials. RTX's defense programs' ability to receive components from Israel has not been impacted in any material respect, though we could experience future delivery delays of certain products because of the current situation. Given the volatile nature of the situation, the potential impacts to RTX are subject to change.See Part I, Item 1A, \\\"Risk Factors\\\" in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these items.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESPreparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. See \\\"Critical Accounting Estimates\\\" within Item 7 and \\\"Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles\\\" within Item 8 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual 34Table of Contentsresults in these areas could differ from management's estimates. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAs described in our \\\"Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results\\\" of this Form 10-Q, our interim period results of operations and period-to-period comparisons of our results, particularly at a segment level, may not be indicative of our future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods, including the discussion of segment results, should be viewed in this context.We provide the organic change in Net sales and Cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations as well as the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit for our segments. We believe that these non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. The organic change in Net sales, Cost of sales, and Operating profit excludes acquisitions and divestitures, net, and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations and other significant non-operational items and/or significant operational items that may occur at irregular intervals (Other). Additionally, the organic change in Cost of sales and Operating profit excludes restructuring costs, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, and costs related to certain acquisition accounting adjustments. Restructuring costs generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions and facility exit costs. We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), primarily related to our Raytheon segment. Acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable.Net Sales Quarter Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)2024202320242023Net sales$20,089 $13,464 $59,115 $48,993 The factors contributing to the change year-over-year in total net sales for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are as follows:(dollars in millions)Quarter Ended September 30, 2024Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024Organic (1)$1,555 $5,589 Acquisitions and divestitures, net(430)(862)Other5,500 5,395 Total change$6,625 $10,122 (1) See \\\"Results of Operations\\\" for definition of organic. A reconciliation of this measure to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.Net sales increased $1.6 billion organically in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher organic net sales of $0.9 billion at Pratt & Whitney, $0.4 billion at Collins, and $0.3 billion at Raytheon.Other sales increased $5.5 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by the absence of the net sales charge of $5.4 billion associated with the Powder Metal Matter recorded in the third quarter of 2023.Net sales increased $5.6 billion organically in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher organic net sales of $3.2 billion at Pratt & Whitney, $1.6 billion at Collins, and $1.0 billion at Raytheon.Other sales increased $5.4 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by the absence of the net sales charge of $5.4 billion associated with the Powder Metal Matter recorded in the third quarter of 2023. 35Table of ContentsThe decreases in net sales due to Acquisitions and divestitures, net of $0.4 billion and $0.9 billion for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were primarily driven by the sale of our Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services (CIS) business within our Raytheon segment completed

The above items were partially offset by the absence of $0.1 billion of charges at Pratt & Whitney related to a customer insolvency recorded in the second quarter of 2023.The decreases in total cost of sales due to Acquisitions and divestitures, net of $0.4 billion and $0.8 billion for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were primarily driven by the sale of our CIS business within our Raytheon segment completed in the first quarter of 2024.Restructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts including workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities. 37Table of ContentsFor discussion on FAS/CAS operating adjustment, see the \\\"FAS/CAS operating adjustment\\\" subsection under the \\\"Segment Review\\\" section below.

Additionally, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $138 million deferred tax benefit associated with legal entity reorganizations and a $56 million tax benefit in response to favorable U.S. Tax Court rulings issued to unrelated taxpayers, but with facts similar to ours. The nature of the tax item in the rulings is subject to a tax matters agreement entered into with Carrier and Otis in connection with the separation of those businesses in 2020, and therefore we recorded a pre-tax charge of $32 million for their respective indemnified amounts.The quarter ended September 30, 2024 also includes a $212 million tax charge related to U.S. federal income taxes now owed by the Company resulting from a favorable non-U.S. tax ruling Otis received in the quarter impacting pre-separation tax years. This tax ruling results in a reduction of U.S. foreign tax credits previously claimed by the Company in pre-separation tax years for which Otis must indemnify us. The Company currently expects to receive approximately $300 million from Otis in connection with the reduction to the foreign tax credits claimed and resulting indemnification obligation. The Company recorded a pre-tax benefit of $212 million representing a portion of the indemnity owed by Otis pursuant to the tax matters agreement and will record the remaining amount owed upon receipt. Additionally, the Company is indemnified for associated interest of $31 million as of September 30, 2024.In addition to items described above, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also includes a $275 million tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2024 resulting from the conclusion of the examination phases of the U.S. federal income tax audits for RTX 2017 and 2018 tax years and Rockwell Collins 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years, a $143 million tax cost associated with the sale of the CIS business, and the effective tax rate impact of the $918 million charge associated with the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters accrued during the second quarter of 2024 where no tax benefit has been recorded.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareowners Quarter Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)2024202320242023Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners$1,472 $(984)$3,292 $1,769 Diluted earnings (loss) per share$1.09 $(0.68)$2.45 $1.21 Net income attributable to common shareowners for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 includes the following:acquisition accounting adjustments of $0.4 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted earnings (loss) per share (EPS) of $0.31.Net loss attributable to common shareowners for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 includes the following:charge associated with the Powder Metal Matter of $2.2 billion, net of tax and partner share, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $1.53; andacquisition accounting adjustments of $0.4 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.28.Net income attributable to common shareowners for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes the following:acquisition accounting adjustments of $1.2 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.89;charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters of $0.9 billion, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.68;a charge of $0.4 billion, net of tax, related to the anticipated Raytheon Contract Termination, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.33;benefit recognized as a result of the conclusion of the examination phases of the RTX and Rockwell Collins tax audits of $0.3 billion, net of tax, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.21;a gain on sale of the CIS business, net of transaction and other related costs, of $0.2 billion, net of tax, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.18; andcharges related to initiating alternative titanium sources at our Collins segment of $0.2 billion, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.13. 41Table of ContentsNet income attributable to common shareowners for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes the following:charge associated with the Powder Metal Matter of $2.2 billion, net of tax and partner share, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $1.52;acquisition accounting adjustments of $1.2 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.80; andcharges on our contract assets and customer financing assets related to a customer insolvency of $0.1 billion, net of tax and noncontrolling interest, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS of $0.08.SEGMENT REVIEWOur operations, for the periods presented herein, are classified into three principal segments: Collins, Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon. Segments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operations, based on capabilities and technologies, where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products and services. Segment Total net sales and Operating profit include intercompany sales and profit, which are ultimately eliminated within Eliminations and other, which also includes certain smaller non-reportable segments. Segment results exclude certain acquisition accounting adjustments, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, and certain corporate expenses, as further discussed below. Given the nature of our business, we believe that total net sales and operating profit (loss) (and the related operating profit (loss) margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management's view of our segment performance, as described below.We provide the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments as discussed above in \\\"Results of Operations.\\\" We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. For Pratt & Whitney only, Other also includes the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at Pratt & Whitney Canada due to its significance to Pratt & Whitney's overall operating results.Total Net Sales.

See \\\"Note 1: Basis of Presentation\\\" within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information.Included in segment Operating profit (loss) are Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments, which relate to changes in Operating profit and margin due to revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion. These changes may reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance, as well as changes in facts and assumptions related to contract options, contract modifications, incentive and award fees associated with program performance, customer activity levels, and other customer-directed changes. For a full description of our EAC process, refer to \\\"Note 5: Changes in Contract Estimates at Completion\\\" within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Given that we have thousands of individual contracts, and given the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an on-going basis, and the nature of the work required to be performed under our contracts, we have both favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments in the ordinary course.We had the following aggregate EAC adjustments for the periods presented:Quarter Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)2024202320242023Gross favorable$260 $247 $803 $851 Gross unfavorable(351)(526)(1,118)(1,284)Total net EAC adjustments$(91)$(279)$(315)$(433)The change in net EAC adjustments of $0.2 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the absence of a $0.1 billion unfavorable impact recorded at Pratt & Whitney in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost to our aftermarket contracts resulting from the Powder Metal Matter.The change in net EAC adjustments of $0.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to favorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Pratt & Whitney, as discussed above, and Raytheon, partially offset by unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Collins. In addition to the amounts included in the table above, during the second quarter of 2024, Raytheon initiated the termination of a fixed price development contract with a foreign customer. As a result of this action, Raytheon recognized a $0.6 billion charge related to the estimated impact of this termination. This charge includes the write-off of remaining contract assets and our best estimate of the expected settlement in conjunction with this termination.Significant EAC adjustments, when they occur, are discussed in each business segment's discussion below.Backlog and Bookings. Total backlog was $221 billion and $196 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total backlog includes commercial backlog of $131 billion and $118 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and defense backlog of $90 billion and $78 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Raytheon backlog was reduced by $1.1 billion as a result of the sale of the CIS business. 43Table of ContentsWe believe bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense businesses. Our defense operations consist primarily of our Raytheon business and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins and Pratt & Whitney segments. Defense bookings were approximately $25 billion and $12 billion for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately $47 billion and $37 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.Bookings are impacted by the timing and amounts of awards in a given period, which are subject to numerous factors, including: the desired capability by the customer and urgency of customer needs, customer budgets and other fiscal constraints, political and economic and other environmental factors, the timing of customer negotiations, and the timing of customer and governmental approvals and notifications. In addition, due to these factors, quarterly bookings tend to fluctuate from period to period, particularly on a segment basis.Collins Aerospace Quarter Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)20242023Change20242023ChangeNet sales$7,075$6,6297 %$20,747$19,1338 %Operating profit1,06290318 %3,0292,69912 %Operating profit margins15.0 %13.6 %14.6 %14.1 %Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions)Organic (1)Acquisitions /Divestitures, netRestructuringCostsOtherTotal ChangeNet sales$387 $- $- $59 $446 Operating profit54 - 52 53 159 (1) See \\\"Segment Review\\\" above for definition of organic. A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.The organic net sales increase of $0.4 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 primarily relates to higher defense sales of $0.3 billion due to higher volume across multiple programs and higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $0.2 billion principally driven by continued growth in commercial air traffic, which has resulted in an increase in flight hours and increased volume. This increase was partially offset by lower commercial aerospace OEM sales of $0.1 billion driven by lower volume on certain narrowbody aircraft.The increase in Other net sales in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the absence of a $0.1 billion charge related to a litigation matter in the third quarter of 2023.The organic operating profit increase of $0.1 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to higher defense operating profit of $0.1 billion, principally driven by the higher sales volume discussed above. Commercial aerospace operating profit in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was relatively flat as higher commercial aftermarket volume was offset by the lower commercial OEM volume discussed above and unfavorable OEM mix.

While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally expect to recover the related Raytheon pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins and Pratt & Whitney generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis. 48Table of ContentsThe components of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment were as follows:Quarter Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)2024202320242023FAS service cost (expense)$(34)$(38)$(103)$(110)CAS expense244 310 739 955 FAS/CAS operating adjustment$210 $272 $636 $845 The changes in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion in the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were driven by a decrease in CAS expense, primarily due to the recognition of historical CAS gain/loss experience.

Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, customer financing requirements, investments in and divestitures of businesses, dividends, common stock repurchases, pension funding, access to 49Table of Contentsthe commercial paper markets, adequacy of available bank lines of credit, redemptions of debt, and the ability to attract long-term capital at satisfactory terms. At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.7 billion, of which approximately 30% was held by RTX's foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The Company intends to repatriate certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. Taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings have been recorded. For the remainder of the Company's undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, RTX will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. Our ability to access global debt markets and the related cost of these borrowings depends on the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our S&P Global credit rating remains at BBB+/negative, and our Moody's Investors Service outlook is Baa1/negative. Though the Company expects to continue having adequate access to funds, declines in our credit ratings or Company outlook could result in higher borrowing costs.As of September 30, 2024, we had a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $5.0 billion, which expires in August 2028. As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement. From time to time, we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments, and repurchases of our common stock. The commercial paper notes have original maturities of not more than 364 days from the date of issuance. As of September 30, 2024, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. At September 30, 2024, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.We made the following repayments of long-term debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:DateDescription of NotesAggregate Principal Balance (in millions)May 7, 20243 Month SOFR plus 1.225% Term Loan due 2025$250 April 17, 20243 Month SOFR plus 1.225% Term Loan due 2025250 April 4, 20243 Month SOFR plus 1.225% Term Loan due 2025250 March 15, 20243.200% notes due 2024950 We have an existing universal shelf registration statement, which we filed with the SEC on September 22, 2022, for an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future issuance, subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement.The Company offers voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) programs with global financial institutions which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institutions at a rate that leverages our credit rating, which might be beneficial to them. Our suppliers' participation in the SCF programs does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers, and therefore, we have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the programs. In addition, we do not pay for any of the costs of the programs incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate, and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to sales of receivables made by those suppliers. As such, the SCF programs do not impact our working capital, cash flows, or overall liquidity.We believe our cash on hand and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Further, we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, as well as the availability under committed credit lines, provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required or appropriate.Cash Flow - Operating Activities Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)20242023Net cash flows provided by operating activities$5,598 $3,172 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a $0.9 billion charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters and a $0.4 billion, net of tax, charge related to the anticipated Raytheon Contract Termination, both of which did not have a significant impact on cash flow in the period. These charges also had the effect of increasing Other accrued liabilities by $1.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 50Table of Contentsincluded a $2.2 billion charge related to the Powder Metal Matter, net of tax, which had no effect on cash flow in that period. This charge also had the effect of increasing Other accrued liabilities by $2.8 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the impact of these charges, the $3.0 billion change in cash flows provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by a favorable impact from accounts receivable driven by increased sales volume and timing of collections, including the related impact of factoring as discussed below, a favorable change in accounts payable driven by timing of payments and an increase in material purchases, and lower tax payments year-over-year including a tax refund received in the second quarter of 2024. These favorable changes were partially offset by the net change in contract assets and contract liabilities due to the timing of collections, and a decrease in Other accrued liabilities due to utilization of the Powder Metal Matter accrual as a result of customer compensation. The Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-parties to sell certain of its receivables, primarily related to customer facilitated programs. The activity in these agreements is generally dependent on underlying delivery volumes within our commercial OEM programs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, factoring activity resulted in an increase of approximately $0.9 billion in cash provided by operating activities, compared to an increase of approximately $0.4 billion in cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Factoring activity includes amounts factored on certain aerospace receivables at the customer's request for which we may be compensated by the customer.We made net tax payments of $0.6 billion and $1.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.While the timing of cash flows are subject to a number of variables, for the Powder Metal Matter we estimate the accrual for expected customer compensation to be utilized consistent with the timing of execution of the fleet management plan, the period of increased aircraft on ground levels, and contractual terms with customers. We currently estimate a full year 2024 cash impact related to the Powder Metal Matter of approximately $1.0 billion. Additionally, we currently estimate full year 2024 cash payments of approximately $1.0 billion related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters and approximately $0.5 billion for the Raytheon Contract Termination executed subsequent to September 30, 2024.Cash Flow - Investing Activities Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)20242023Net cash flows used in investing activities$(755)$(2,061)Our investing activities primarily include capital expenditures, cash investments in customer financing assets, investments in and dispositions of businesses, payments related to our collaboration intangible assets and contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, and settlements of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments. The $1.3 billion change in cash flows used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily related to the sale of our CIS business within our Raytheon segment for proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion in cash.During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we increased other intangible assets by $0.4 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, primarily related to collaboration payment commitments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce's collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE) and exclusivity payments made on contractual commitments included within intangible assets.Cash Flow - Financing Activities Nine Months Ended September 30,(dollars in millions)20242023Net cash flows used in financing activities$(4,749)$(1,909)Our financing activities primarily include the issuance and repayment of commercial paper and other short-term and long-term debt, payment of dividends, and stock repurchases. The $2.8 billion change in cash flows used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by prior year long-term debt issuances of $3.0 billion, an increase in long-term debt repayments of $1.5 billion, and lower issuances of commercial paper, net, of $0.5 billion, partially offset by lower year-over-year share repurchases of $2.2 billion. Refer to \\\"Note 9: Borrowings and Lines of Credit\\\" within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information on debt issuances and repayments and commercial paper.At September 30, 2024, management had remaining authority to repurchase approximately $0.7 billion of our common stock under the October 21, 2023 share repurchase program. Under the 2023 program, shares may be purchased on the open market, 51Table of Contentsin privately negotiated transactions, under accelerated share repurchase programs, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We may also reacquire shares outside of the program in connection with the surrender of shares to cover taxes on vesting of restricted stock and as required under our employee savings plan. Our ability to repurchase shares is subject to applicable law.Our share repurchases, which include shares reacquired outside of our share repurchase program, were as follows:Nine Months Ended September 30,20242023(dollars in millions; shares in thousands)$Shares$SharesShares of common stock repurchased (1)$136 1,365 $2,587 29,397 ASR Tranche 1 settlement - shares received (2)- 391 - - ASR Tranche 2 settlement - financing cash paid (2) (3)258 - - - Total shares of common stock repurchased$394 1,756 $2,587 29,397 (1) Amounts relate to share repurchases that were settled in cash during the period.(2) Includes the settlement of the ASR first and second tranches in the third quarter of 2024.
